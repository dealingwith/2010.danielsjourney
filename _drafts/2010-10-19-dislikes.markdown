title: "Things That I Strongly Dislike More Now Than I Used To"

I thought maybe this experience was going to make me a better person in many respects, but in particular my intolerance for certain things. Not so. In no particular order:

* People who leave voicemail. Not _everyone_ who leave voicemails, but for example I was on a flight the other day and the guy next to me left the longest voicemail in the history of voicemails. It was so long I had to send Carissa a text message informing her of my bewilderment at his ability to monologue into a voice recording device. _However_, on the return flight of the same trip, another douchebag next to me, who must have become aware of the new Voicemail Message Length world record, proceeded to leave a voicemail _no shorter than_ 10 minutes long! It was seriously unbelievable, and I had to continually challenge reality as he continued on and on. It was very much like the business douchebag on the plane in <a href="http://vod.fxnetworks.com/watch/louie/221105606001?start=474&stop=554" title="I would link directly to the scene but that feature seems to be broken">Louie</a> episode, except much longer and as a message not a conversation.  
* People who hunt-and-peck. Speaking of douchebag businessmen on flights in and out of Dallas, who hunts and peck types anymore? You have to look at the keyboard to find the letter you want to type, putting your Very Important Words down at a speed slower than my six year old stepson could spell them? Who do you have a job that requires you communicate with the written word?  
* People who use Outlook, especially those people who spend half their day in Outlook. Your job revolves around email and you use Outlook? It's like saying your job is to win the Tour de France but you have to ride a penny farthing bicycle. 
* People who use Twitter hashtags #stabmyself and #fml 
* Related: Drama Kings and Queens
* Old people who drive slowly with their mouths open. Slow is ok, it's the mouth hanging open that communicates maybe you should look into some transportation options. That and the oxygen tank (I only saw this once and it was in Florida. Guy was doing 40 on the freeway. Left lane.)
* Your children. Honestly. They are either small and cute and remind me of what fate took from me; or they are a little older and annoying or selfish or the host of other things
