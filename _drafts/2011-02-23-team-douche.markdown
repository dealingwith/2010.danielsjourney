It's not a big secret that bike racers are more often than not vain assholes. Which of course is hilarious given they are grown men* with shaved legs wearing multicolored skin-tight outfits with padding over the taint and ass area. There are notable exceptions, there are even tolerable 

At least one mistake on a bike ride is better than being a douche bag your whole life. I wonder how many times that guy has to masturbate every night to get it all out of his system.

What would the opposite of Team Douche be? Team Still Stinky Where It's Supposed To Be? Team Already Fresh and Clean Thank You Very Much?
