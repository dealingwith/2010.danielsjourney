The writing, performing and recording of music has taken a serious back seat in my life the last few years. I'm still involved,   [ releases and planned releases and projects ]    ...But I haven't written a song since...well, I used to write songs on the spot for Margot all the time. Sometimes to comfort her, sometimes because her beauty and aura inspired spontaneous singing.

And that's the main reason my singing voice has been silent for the last year, because it has been silenced by the pain, its joy robbed. Some people, even myself for a very short while, thought music and writing songs might be a good outlet for some of this. But it turns out that when I noodle on the guitar or piano, and begin to form some new music, there are no words that can come. Sometimes some words come at first but they fail so magnificently to capture anything near the reality of this situation. I think songs and poetry can capture things like romantic heartbreak just fine*. But this is so beyond words. Everything feels trite. It takes a special person and probably a lot of distance in terms of time and context. 

> ...have patience with everything unresolved in your heart, and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them.

-- Rainer Maria Rilke, from *Letters to a Young Poet*
