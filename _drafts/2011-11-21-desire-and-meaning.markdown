I had promised that [this post about the problem of desire](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/10/02/desire.html) would be continued and before I end this chapter of my blogging life I want to try and wrap it up. Except it's complicated. I was discussing motivations and plans with a trusted friend and said, "...but of course it's never about the money. It's about how we see ourselves, about how these things support the narrative of who we think we are" (or something like that).

The original tagline of [danielsjourney.com](http://danielsjourney.com/blog) was "seeking, stories, beauty, meaning" which eventually became lost in the masses of "series of single words" taglines out there. But as I look back at it, it was smarter than I give my past self credit for. Meaning--the ultimate question to which our lives are the answer, that thing that I so much desire now, something tangible to make sense of all this. Seeking--an acknowledgment of its infinite distance. Beauty--where we can see glimpses of it day-to-day, in so many places, should we be on the lookout for it and have our hearts, open in gratitude, ready to catch it. Stories--how we weave it all together into something we can understand and gives *tomorrow* meaning, even if the events of yesterday throw the reason for the sum of our days into doubt and disarray.

This is the last post I'll write on this blog. I'm going back to my "main" blog, and will keep this one here as an archive of this time. I'm not done processing this. I'm not done recovering even a little bit from this. I have no idea how long those processes will take but I suspect it will be a very long time. 

But it is time to stop writing publicly about it in such an explicit manner. Obviously I'll still blog about philosophical things, and cycling, and culture, and my various projects, (and tech) on my blog. 

There were a lot of things I had still wanted to say here, but life has demanded more time and energy than I could spare to consider or communicate them, which is probably a really good thing. It's time to focus on Lucy, my marriage, my work.

In case you missed it above, [here is the link to my old/new blog](http://danielsjourney.com/blog). The RSS feed, the Twitter and Facebook postings will automatically switch over. See you over there.

<p class="postscript">Oh and there is a lot of old sh*t over there. I'm going to something interesting with the archives, I just haven't figured it all out yet...if you dare venture into the past, click at your own risk...it's a regular Chernobyl.</p>
