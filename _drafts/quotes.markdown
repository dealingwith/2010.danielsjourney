J. R. R. Tolkien:

> Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends.

> All that is gold does not glitter; not all those that wander are lost.

> If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.
