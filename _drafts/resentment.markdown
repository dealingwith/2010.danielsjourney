This is a really hard subject to write about and one I won't be able to explore fully either here or, even, in my thoughts. Just a [flickr search on the term](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=resentment&l=cc&ss=2&ct=6&mt=all&adv=1&z=t#page=0) reveals this a subject we have little facility expressing even in an abstract way. But it remains the largest of the various black clouds still looming over my head.

I've [hinted](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/01/23/all-you-lucky-people.html), [outright mentioned it](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/19/winter.html) and [even been a dick about it](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/11/26/dislikes.html) before. But man, those words still don't express the really dark shit that lingers on the sideline, just waiting for coach to send them in. It's late in the game and it's raining and I'm just trying to move my team down field and then I see them break through the offensive line and head straight for me, head down, full speed, teeth gritting.

God, I hate what this has done to me. I hate what it has made me. 

I'm not going to be able to write more about this subject right now. Or maybe ever. I'm just going to listen to loud music and try and find my way to morning.
