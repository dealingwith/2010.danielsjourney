As an addendum to [yesterday's post](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/06/06/still.html)*

<p class="date">June 07, 2011</p>

<p class="postscript">* Have you noticed that I've started to use my URLs to encode more information about the post? It's actually because I have to decide the URL before the title, which I normally don't decide on until after I've written the post...and I stopped caring enough to go back and change the URL. So yesterday's "still" was some vague reference to the fact that I'm [still dealing with the why question](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/05/why.html) or that some things are still a struggle or...I don't know.</p>
