"The only reason I am alive is because I could not die." Ghost Rider pg 7

"...most couples do not stay together after losing a child. Outrageous! So wrong, so unfair, so cruel, to heap more pain and injustice on those who had suffered so much already. In my blissful ignorance, I would have imagined the opposite--that those who most shared the loss would cling to each other. But no.

"Maybe it's because the mutually bereaved represent a constant reminder to each other, almost a reproach, or it might run as deep as the 'selfish genes' rejecting an unsuccessful effort at reproduction. Whatever it was, it was harsh to think that Jackie and I had survived 22 years...and now the loss of what we each treasured most would drive us apart." pg 7-8
