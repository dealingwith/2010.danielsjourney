Yesterday I wanted to write a post about how the current cultural climate in this country, thick as it is with ignorance and hate, saddens and angers me more than it ever has. The day prior I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(internet)">flamed</a> a Facebook thread full of that very hate and racism. But I just read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/opinion/12kristof.html" style="font-style: italic">Is This America?</a> and I couldn't have said it better myself.

It is clear to me now that we are at the end of empire, but we are very far from apocalypse or redemption. People read their own experience and world view into current events and think it has something to do with <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201&amp;version=NASB">Revelation</a>. I read my own experience and world view and it is pretty clear that while some of our nation's inhabitants proclaim a faith in Christ, he no more favors our selfish machinations than he did any of those who came before us. 

Besides, we do not live the faith we proclaim. We do not speak it. We speak hate in his name. I suspect he simply weeps.<blockquote>After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.</blockquote>_1 Kings 19_, via <a href="http://www.kesterbrewin.com/2010/09/10/the-burning-issue-has-terry-jones-thought-this-through/">this Kester Brewin post</a> that also says it better than I am.

I would take back the f-bombs of my Facebook flame, but I wouldn't take back this part: that in the midst of my pain, their hate and racism draws into sharp light a strange comfort--that Margot will never have to tolerate it.
