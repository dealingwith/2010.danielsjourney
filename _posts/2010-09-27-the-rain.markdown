Again and again  
When I look at this man  
He hasn't taken a drop and  
He laughs as he used to  
I think: it's getting better  
Spring is coming, good times are coming  
The times that are gone  
Have returned  
Love is beginning again, soon  
Things will be like they once were.  

Again and again  
When I've been chatting with him  
He has eaten his supper and doesn't go out  
He is speaking to me and  
Hasn't got his hat on  
I think: it will be all right  
Ordinary times are over  
One can talk  
To a chap, he listens  
Love is beginning again, soon  
Things will be just like they once were.  

The rain  
Never falls upwards.  
When the wound  
Stops hurting  
What hurts is  
The scar
