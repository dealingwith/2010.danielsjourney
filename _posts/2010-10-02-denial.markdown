Believe it or not, despite most of my time being spent in the depression or anger stages, I still sometimes slip into denial, now, more than a month and a half later. I fantasize about turning a corner and seeing her there, her turning towards me and smiling that amazing smile of hers. I try to comprehend how this nightmare is so real that I can't wake up from it, and try.

It just still seems so impossible.
