"You weren't married?" has been my favorite of the various responses since Sunday (I've heard it twice). It speaks to the reality not the formality. Still, I like seeing the ring on her hand. I like thinking about it. I like the one word titles. _Wife_.

I liked <a href="http://carissabyers.blogspot.com/2010/10/pinky-swear.html">how we went about getting married</a>, in the end. It was more than a trip to the courthouse but way less than a typical wedding. I liked the constraints we had in terms of planning time and guest list and the simplicity* it helped engender.

There was one guest I had always imagined being front and center with her big smile and bright eyes. I hope she was smiling anyway.
