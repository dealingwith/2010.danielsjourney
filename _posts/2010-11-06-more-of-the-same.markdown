* I'm still mostly sad.
* I still miss my daughter all the time.
* Happy times are still marked by her absence.
* Everything would be perfect if she were still here.
* I'm still ready for a fight that won't come and wouldn't help anything anyway.
* I still exist in a world that continues on despite all these things.
* I still struggle to resist the urge to just totally drop out.
* I still feel really betrayed but I'm not sure with whom.
* I would still do anything to have her back again.
