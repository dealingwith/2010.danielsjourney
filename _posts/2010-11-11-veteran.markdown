Mothers and fathers  
of those who won't grow old  
because of other men's plans  
you have someone to blame  
you have someone to blame  

Their hearts are so cold  
they would kill your son  
with a movement of their pen  
and still you take their flag  
and still you take their flag  

They write you a letter  
and shoot into the air  
and celebrate today those who escaped alive  
the riots of their murderous machinations
