Had the opportunity to visit Boulder, CO, for the first time last week and I immediately fell in love. From the [tacos](http://www.illegalpetes.com/) to the somehow always [excellent](http://atlaspurveyors.com/) [espresso](http://tridentcafe.com/) to the [fancy drinks](http://www.happynoodlehouse.com/TheBitterBar/tabid/464/Default.aspx) to the mountains. Mostly the mountains. Since moving away from Tucson at the end of 1997 I've only been in the (real) mountains a couple of times, and I'd forgotten how good they are for my soul. 

Now I have a huge city crush on Boulder and am trying to figure out how to move there so I can go up into those mountains whenever I need sanity, peace or comfort.
