Last week was a pretty bad week emotionally/spiritually. I'm not really sure why, it could have been the pendulum swinging back from my [good time in Boulder](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/12/08/boulder.html) or the general [FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) both worldwide and locally. It might be the onset of the Christmas season and the fact that all good things are stained with this loss. 

Saturday I had reason to drive to Fort Worth and on the way there and back I listened to [The Moth](http://www.themoth.org/) podcast of stories told at their various storytelling events. I was headed back when this one came up, a story told almost a decade ago by [Andrew Solomon](http://www.google.com/search?q=Andrew+Solomon). I should warn you, what it describes is horrible and should only be heard at the right moment. Fortify yourself. But it is also a story of incredible strength and hope. I was somewhere in the [Mid-Cities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Cities) when he finished and the whole thing washed over me at once--both an intense sadness and a weight-lifting, as if my own burden of sadness, pain and injustice briefly ascended to join with all those who also knew of it and more.
