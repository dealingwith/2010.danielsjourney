I hope at this point anyone in Dallas reading this blog knows about [what happened in our community](http://www.dallasobserver.com/2011-01-06/music/remembering-frankie-45/) this week. If you don't, go read that fitting tribute by Pete Freedman, as well as [this one by our friend Bill Holston](http://frontrow.dmagazine.com/2011/01/bill-holston-frankie-45-left-it-on-the-stage/). I only knew Frankie and only know Frank from seeing them at the Kettle gallery and Dada. Obviously I now feel connected to Frank. I don't know what else to say about this, or how to possibly reach out to him. The place he now inhabits, and will be, where I still am, it is indescribable and unknowable and unique for each person within it.
