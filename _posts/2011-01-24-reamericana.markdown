In 2003 I lived in Bosnia for a few months and while there recorded a little four-song EP, the _Americana EP_. I was really proud of it, it was my first time working with a producer and it was my first project since 1997. I'll have to "re-print" the epic story of the Bosnian disc reproduction _mofiasco_ on here soon for those who haven't already heard it.

After the first _[Happy Sounding Sad Songs](http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/happy-sounding-sad-songs)_ sessions I wasn't quite happy with the collection. There were a few songs on it that sounded like they belonged more with the previous _Americana EP_ than with the rest of their companions on _HSSS_. I tabled those three, recorded two new ones _([IDKWTDAT](http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/i-dont-know-what-to-do-about-that "I Don't Know What to do About That") & [Clich&eacute;](http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/clich]))_, and that was that.

I had it in my mind to re-work _Americana_ since then. The original EP only used sampled drums and on a couple of the songs they sounded, well, sampled. I wanted real drums on those, combine them with the 3 stragglers from _HSSS_, ignore the fact that someone without a career has no place releasing a B-sides compilation, and whammo: new record.

Well it took a while to get around to re-working those old tracks. I had to find a studio that could import them. Then we discovered my producer back in Sarajevo had made a mistake with the backups, and I was missing most of one of the songs. We worked on the other three, adding new guitars and drums and some keys. We mixed more professionally. I mashed-up a little ending for _Closed_ that harkens forward to the (now-past) remake of [_Dream Town_ on _HSSS_](http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/american-dream-town). I ended up throwing out one more song.

Anyway, everything was ready to go last summer. Then some stuff happened. 

Anyway, here it is.
