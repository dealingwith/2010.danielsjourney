> I wonder where I fit in the scheme of things.  Especially while I am out riding my bike...which I do almost like a religion nowadays.  Compelled somehow, but wrapped in a fear and a certainty that this is a fool's paradise.   I am visited day and night with memories, and no good ones, reenactments of days of pain long passed by.

> There may never be another super bowl for me.  But death calls out, and life refuses to hear.  **It is all wasted on thirty second commercials, selling things no living man has any need of, only dead men spend their money so stupidly.**

> Two weeks ago, Grewal took part in Wheat Ridge Cyclery's Crooked Roubaix, his first competitive event since his retirement. Despite riding a mountain bike, flat pedals and hiking boots, Grewal finished the 90-mile gran fondo-style high-altitude event on dirt and paved roads in the leading group, crossing the line in fourth place out of a field of some 125 starters.

I had a long post composed in my mind about how last night's spectacle made me lose all hope for humanity, as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=groupon+super+bowl+commercial" title="and that was only one example of many">the commercials proved we  no longer have any compassion for our fellow man</a> and the players (and I assume fans) credited God for their good plays. We believe He has an opinion on the matter of sports performance but not, apparently, on human suffering. I also have planned a long post about cycling and the dark cloud that currently looms over its greatest spectacles. I still might write the latter. In the meantime, I am happy to turn this post about the Super Bowl into a post about cycling.

> Maybe this whole doping issue is here to turn us from our own selfishness to see that we have not as yet realized that the bicycle and bicycle racing has a purpose and meaning we have yet to even think about or care to understand. I think we are missing the real reality of what we have in the bicycle and in the racing of it.
