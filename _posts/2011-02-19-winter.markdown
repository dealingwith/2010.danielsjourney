Six months and six days. That's how long it's been. The six month mark passed without event, in fact even the 14th was pretty good, we even had a [rock star dinner guest](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wheeler-Sparks/334053513499). Tuesday it all fell apart. Wednesday was back to just ok. And so it goes. Now it's already Saturday in a WTF kind of speed.

The temperatures have risen to the 80's and even though ride preparation takes a few fewer seconds and there's less nose blowing during rides\*, it feels far, far too soon. Winters are a quiet kind of sad and still. In a way that was helpful. My soul's not renewing, so why should the Earth? Anyway, seems all it means is bugs and sweat and wind.

I want to give some kind of meaningful update or information, but everything I've already said still holds true. [Being reminded of her, or the event, or the loss...any reminders still must be avoided](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/02/in-order-to-remember-we-must-first-forget.html), the pain is still so debilitating. [Motivation is still elusive](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/29/motivation-mood.html). [Your shit is still really fucking petty](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/11/26/dislikes.html) and I still really don't want to see your babies.

It still seems like I'm just beating off depression and pain and (honest) sadness and resentment like it's my full time job. I just want my daughter back. I just want to be a daddy again. I just want my life back.
