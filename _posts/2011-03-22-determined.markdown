I've said before that there are certain questions that are now &ldquo;[best escorted out of the park by security](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/24/what-now.html)&rdquo; ...and maybe you noticed that was the first of a trilogy: "What now?" &ldquo;[I'll go on.](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/28/I-can-not-go-on.html)&rdquo; &ldquo;[Not because \[I want\] to but because \[I have\] to.](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/03/07/bikes.html)&rdquo;

The problem with the deeper questions surrounding our loss and our lives is that they are the questions that have existed for all time and our answers--or lack thereof--are the same as well. The search for meaning evolves into a search to be more human, to connect to--not a Truth--but the truth of what it means to here with others.

So today I was reading some posts by my friend Kester Brewin and he wrote [something that made a tiny bit of sense](http://www.kesterbrewin.com/2011/03/15/free-will-determinism-heaven-hell/):

> ...we cannot prove if heaven and hell exist, but it's a natural response to want the world to be fair, to be sorted out and judged at some point so that justice is done. A deterministic universe it might be--just chemicals and electrons--but this is not a world that we find "human" precisely because it makes a nonsense of ideas of love--and hate too.
