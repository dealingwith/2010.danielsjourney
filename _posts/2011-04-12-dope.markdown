I [mentioned a while ago](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/07/super-bowl.html) that I might write a long post about the doping issue in professional cycling. At the time I was catching up on all the information available, specifically about Lance Armstrong and in light of the [very long interview of Floyd Landis](http://nyvelocity.com/content/interviews/2011/landiskimmage) I spent quite a few days reading and analyzing. If you're really interested in this subject, I suggest you read it.

In the meantime, Bicycling magazine's Bill Strickland has [published a really well done piece in their latest issue](https://www.readability.com/articles/hfwviezu) which says everything I wanted to say but with more writing talent, insight and experience than I have.
