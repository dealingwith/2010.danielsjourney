Things have been [busy](http://twitter.com/#!/withextrasauce/status/60026226236080128) and will continue to be so. There is more good news to come. There is work to be done. It still comes and goes in waves. There are still a couple things I wrestle with and perhaps will make observations about on this blog but for the most part this is wrapping itself up and I am trying to strategize a move back to--and re-inclusion of the archives of--my regular blog.

Here are some pics of recent life:
