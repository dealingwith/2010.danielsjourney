I should warn you, this story* by Anthony Griffith is intense. The title does not do it justice; but then no title could. I'm not sure what prompted me to listen to it on my drive home from work today. I'm also not sure how I managed to drive through the tears. But I'm glad I did. It was very cathartic and he put into words so many things I've wished I could put into words here. I found myself shouting over my sobs, "Yes. Yes. Yes."
