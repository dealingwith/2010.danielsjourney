Sun Lux's new record _We Are Rising_ is a must have. It's blowing my mind more with every listen. There are a few songs that cut a little too close to the bone, and those I must skip. But overall it is a record well described by the title. [Go get it here](http://t.co/84FfI4Q) or [through Bandcamp](http://music.sonluxmusic.com/album/we-are-rising).

<p class="postscript"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sonlux/status/86842264919359488">Ryan Lott himself replied to me on Twitter the other day</a>. I must confess I was chuffed. He was even replying to a tweet I sent <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dealingwith/status/86305338650918912">in reply to a separate conversation</a>. I don't have the heart to tell him I can't listen to <em>Flowers</em> anymore, either.
