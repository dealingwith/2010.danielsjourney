As Lucy's presence becomes more real (we had another sonogram yesterday and she's healthy and moved a little bit for us while we watched in awe) I am forced to face the coming reality that there will be another beautiful girl in our house at the same time I will still (always) feel the loss of my first child. Even as I contemplated names this morning I thought, "'Margot Rose Miller' was the perfect name. You can't top that." 

I don't want to have any weird expectations on Lucy. But the part of my soul that needs this all to be woven into a mystical, meaningful narrative wants to feel like both Margot and Lucy are special and ordained, each with a place and purpose, things that from my perspective will always be linked.

Margot was already such an important person, not just because she was as beautiful and perfect as a baby can be. Margot was a miracle, she was redemption, she was the fulfillment of a decade's worth of desire&hellip;and that was only in her being. As she grew she became [exceptional](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/08/glue.html) in even more, unexpected ways.

> Lucy, tell me the truth, 'cause I'm in love with you.
