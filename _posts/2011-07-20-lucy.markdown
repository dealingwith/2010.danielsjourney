As Lucy&rsquo;s presence becomes more real (we had another sonogram yesterday and she&rsquo;s healthy and moved a little bit for us while we watched in awe) I am forced to face the coming reality that there will be another beautiful girl in our house at the same time I will still (always) feel the loss of my first child. Even as I contemplated names this morning I thought, &ldquo;&lsquo;Margot Rose Miller&rsquo; was the perfect name. You can&rsquo;t top that.&rdquo; 

I don&rsquo;t want to have any weird expectations on Lucy. But the part of my soul that needs this all to be woven into a mystical, meaningful narrative wants to feel like both Margot and Lucy are special and ordained, each with a place and purpose, things that from my perspective will always be linked.

Margot was already such an important person, not just because she was as beautiful and perfect as a baby can be. Margot was a miracle, she was redemption, she was the fulfillment of a decade&rsquo;s worth of desire&hellip;and that was only in her being. As she grew she became [exceptional](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/08/glue.html) in even more, unexpected ways.

Lucy is somehow part of the answer to the question that will never be answered completely.

> Lucy, tell me the truth, &lsquo;cause I'm in love with you.

<p class="postscript">Obviously the Paul Slavens song was written from the standpoint of a suitor, to a potential lover. But the line above stuck with me. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alphabet-Girls-Vol-I/dp/B003MRM8RQ/">The record the song comes from is one of my favorite from last year; you should pick it up</a>.</p>
