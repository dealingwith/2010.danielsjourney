Ezra Caldwell* posted an intimate and important** [post](http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/?p=702) that I want to both capture for my future reference and share with you:

> Sitting there on the water I began to talk myself into a state of utter self loathing&hellip;An hour later, though, I found myself in a little sleeping cabin apart from the house, curled up in the fetal position completely catatonic. My mind was racing, and none of it good. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine how, for instance, how I was going to be able to get back to NYC. (&ldquo;Drive the rental car, you fool!&rdquo; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t possibly! I might drive it off the road and kill my wife in a state of self distructive insanity!&rdquo;)&hellip;

> From somewhere far back in my head, I watched myself go crazy.  There was a part of me in there that found the whole thing fascinating.  A part of me that was saying, &ldquo;Ok Ezra&hellip;snap out of it. This is nonsense.&rdquo; Intellectually I was able to recognize that what was going on was madness and yet I couldn&rsquo;t stop the waves of very real emotions that were overwhelming me.

> I had lost *all* confidence. The swagger and cockiness that held me together for the last 3 years simply vanished. I guess I had been waiting for that to happen&hellip;I was forced to recognize that without the arrogance, the thing that I really hate about myself, I simply fell apart. (I realize now, that I have about three years of justifiable falling apart to catch up on!)

> Hill had been napping inside, and came out to find me. I couldn&lsquo;t even speak. I managed finally to say, &ldquo;Baby&hellip;I&rsquo;m in serious trouble.&rdquo;

> Special Ed brought a bottle of bourbon out and helped me talk my way back to earth. I went inside and cooked dinner.

My friend and producer Salim Nourallah has a new record coming out this summer. Be on the lookout for it. This tune crossed my desk about the same time as Ezra's post and seemed to just fit. Had a stressful day today, but it&rsquo;s odd how not-really-stressful &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stress is to me now. Intellectually I know that circumstances are stressful, I even see it written across my friends&rsquo; faces&hellip;but my heart is less troubled. The scale [has been re-calibrated after all](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/28/I-can-not-go-on.html).

<p class="postscript">* Who you <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/10/24/fast-boy.html">will remember from previous posts</a>.<br><br>** &hellip;at least for those who have also experienced traumatic times in their lives; it ties into a lot of things about fear that I have been thinking about lately; about how to deal with the realities of the future given the horrors of the past; about <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/06/a-black-wave-is-comin.html">coping</a> with whatever that traumatic experience did to one's psychology.</p>
