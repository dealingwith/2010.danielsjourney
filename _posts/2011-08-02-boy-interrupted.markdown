Up very early for reasons I need not bore you with I ended up reading Spector 45[*](/2011/01/08/frankie.html) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Spector-45/90880981950) [pages](http://www.facebook.com/groups/182908695071445/) and someone had posted about this film and I clicked the "watch a clip" button and the last bit of this video I'm posting here made me cry again[*](/2011/06/13/best-worst-of-times.html). Made me say "Yes, yes, yes" through my tears again.
