This morning I had to get up and get downtown to appear in court for a ticket I got while riding my bike around White Rock Lake. The Dallas Police enjoy hiding out near the stop signs on the roads cyclist frequent, especially on the weekend when they know they will be able to pick off rider after rider rolling through stop signs. Fortunately my case was dismissed.

365 days ago I woke up from the first of a number of nights sleeping in the ICU. 

Today I'm just trying to find some focus. I have client meetings today and tomorrow. I have two huge deliverables in the next five days. I've only ridden my bike twice in the last five days.

But it's hard.
