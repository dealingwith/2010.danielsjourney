Yesterday improved. My meeting went really well and then I took the opportunity to visit my new friend Gerhard in [Roanoke](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Roanoke,+tx). Gerhard is the person I vaguely mentioned [in the footnote of this post](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/08/03/get-over-yourself.html) and the story is long and important and I don't want to do it injustice so I'm not going to attempt to tell it right now. 

Had a cigar, talked about life, [ate too much](http://mlkshk.com/p/5ZM5), drank delicious German beer. Soul restorage.
