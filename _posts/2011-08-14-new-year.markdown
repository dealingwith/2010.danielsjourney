And so a new morning arrived. And I rode 55 miles, in the company of people I enjoy, [40 of which were on roads I'd never seen before](http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/mVQYeo7T-tg) and were rather nice for cycling. Some of them even reminded me of the roads I grew up riding on in PA. It was the perfect way to start a new year.

At first I thought Lucy's conception would change something. Then the year mark. Of course things never work that way. This will stay with me forever. How I live within it changes. I wish I could be to the place where I could see her pictures. I didn't expect to yet be to the place where I could watch video or listen to the audio I'd captured of her talking and singing. But I had hoped to be able to see her beautiful, perfect face, not fear seeing it for risk of losing my shit.

I had more to say but have run out of time multiple times. Thank you all for your well-portioned reaching-outs yesterday. So for now, a small mix.

([Here is the directory with all the tunes, for your time-shifted enjoyment](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/NewYear/). There is one bonus track in there, not included in the player because there is a reader of this blog for whom it would be too difficult to hear.)
