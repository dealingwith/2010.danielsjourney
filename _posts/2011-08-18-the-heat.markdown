It would seem the heat is driving everyone insane. For a while we were kept excited about breaking the 100 degree consecutive-day record. Then we had one 98 degree day and fell short by a few days. The worst thing you can offer a hopeless society is a short moment of hope. It then returned to 100+ degree temps and we all just got quiet and stopped discussing it and all started acting a little insane. Our driving skills diminished. Our irritability increased. Our general sense of hope and well being decreased...

> It's summertime and I can understand if you still feel sad.
