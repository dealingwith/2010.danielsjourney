I wonder how many people are out there who wish you would not use the anniversary of their loss to be patriotic. To repeat trite adages. To hashtag where you were when they lost the person that was most important to them. To make their loss about the flag and about terrorists and about yourself. 

You extract meaning from their pain. You think the event is important to you. But this moment means nothing to you compared to them.

It's possible they would just like to spend a moment in mourning and then move on.
