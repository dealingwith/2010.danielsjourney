> The problem is I'm older now, I'm 40 years old, and this stuff doesn't change the world. It really doesn't.

> "I'm sorry, it's true. Having children really changes your view on these things. We're born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It's been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much--if at all.

> "These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I'm not downplaying that.

> "But it's a disservice to constantly put things in this radical new light--that it's going to change everything. Things don't have to change the world to be important." [[Wired, February 1996](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html)]

> "We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn't build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren't going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.

> "When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through." [[Playboy, Feb. 1, 1985](http://www.scribd.com/doc/43945579/Playboy-Interview-With-Steve-Jobs)]

> "Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked...

> "Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.

> "Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have." [Wired, February 1996]

> "So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously rich, they're gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives. Without it, they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective." [Fortune, Jan. 24, 2000]

> "[Innovation] comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much." [[BusinessWeek, Oct. 12, 2004](http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041012_4018_db083.htm)]

> "Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me...Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful...that's what matters to me." [The Wall Street Journal, May 25, 1993]
