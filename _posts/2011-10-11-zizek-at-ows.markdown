In the final two sentences of [his speech to the protests on Wall Street](http://www.fishrockroad.org/2011/10/zizek-at-occupy-wall-street.html), Zizek warns of desire:

> We know that people often desire something but do not really want it. Don't be afraid to really want what you desire.

<p class="postscript">The entire speech is well worth reading. &ldquo;The only sense in which are communists is that we care for the commons...Communism failed absolutely, but the problems of the commons are here.&rdquo;</p>
