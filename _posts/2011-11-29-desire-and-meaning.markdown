I had promised that [this post about the problem of desire](http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/10/02/desire.html) would be continued and before I end this chapter of my blogging life I want to try and wrap it up. Except it's complicated. I was discussing motivations and plans with a trusted friend and said, "...but of course it's never about the money. It's about how we see ourselves, about how these things support the narrative of who we think we are" (or something like that).

At any rate, I don't have time to finish those thoughts exactly. They are heavily influenced, as I mentioned, by [Pete Rollins](http://peterrollins.net/), specifically his thoughts on [desire](http://peterrollins.net/?tag=desire) and [drive](http://peterrollins.net/?tag=drive) (which in turn are influenced by [Lacan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Lacan)). It is also heavily influenced by Victor Frankl, who wrote [a famous book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man's_Search_for_Meaning) on meaning. I would suggest you just go read all that stuff.

The original tagline of [danielsjourney.com](http://danielsjourney.com/) was "seeking, stories, beauty, meaning" which eventually became lost in the masses of "series of single words" taglines out there. But as I look back at it, it was smarter than I give my past self credit for. In not the same order: Meaning--the ultimate question to which our lives are the answer, that thing that I so much desire now, something tangible to make sense of all this. Seeking--an acknowledgment of its infinite distance. Beauty--where we can see glimpses of it day-to-day, in so many places, should we be on the lookout for it and have our hearts, [open in gratitude, ready to catch it, despite the threats against it](http://fora.tv/2010/03/11/Sam_Keen_In_The_Absence_of_God#chapter_06). Stories--how we weave it all together into something we can understand and gives *tomorrow* meaning, even if the events of yesterday throw the reason for the sum of our days into doubt and disarray.

This is the last post I'll write on this blog. I'm going back to my "main" blog, and will keep this one here as an archive of this time. I'm not done processing this. I'm not done recovering even a little bit from this. I have no idea how long those processes will take but I suspect it will be a very long time. 

But it is time to stop writing publicly about it in such an explicit manner. Obviously I'll still blog about philosophical things, and cycling, and culture, and my various projects, (and tech) on my blog. 

There were a lot of things I had still wanted to say here, but life has demanded more time and energy than I could spare to consider or communicate them, which is probably a really good thing. It's time to focus on Lucy, my marriage, my work.

Once I get my new/old blog up and running, the RSS feed, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/_danielsjourney) and Facebook postings will automatically switch over. See you over there.
