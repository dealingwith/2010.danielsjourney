<p>I wonder where I fit in the scheme of things. Especially while I am out riding my bike&#8230;which I do almost like a religion nowadays. Compelled somehow, but wrapped in a fear and a certainty that this is a fool&#8217;s paradise. I am visited day and night with memories, and no good ones, reenactments of days of pain long passed by.</p>

<p>There may never be another super bowl for me. But death calls out, and life refuses to hear. <strong>It is all wasted on thirty second commercials, selling things no living man has any need of, only dead men spend their money so stupidly.</strong></p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Grewal took part in Wheat Ridge Cyclery&#8217;s Crooked Roubaix, his first competitive event since his retirement. Despite riding a mountain bike, flat pedals and hiking boots, Grewal finished the 90-mile gran fondo-style high-altitude event on dirt and paved roads in the leading group, crossing the line in fourth place out of a field of some 125 starters.</p>

<hr />
<p>I had a long post composed in my mind about how last night&#8217;s spectacle made me lose all hope for humanity, as <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=groupon+super+bowl+commercial' title='and that was only one example of many'>the commercials proved we  no longer have any compassion for our fellow man</a> and the players (and I assume fans) credited God for their good plays. We believe He has an opinion on the matter of sports performance but not, apparently, on human suffering. I also have planned a long post about cycling and the dark cloud that currently looms over its greatest spectacles. I still might write the latter. In the meantime, I am happy to turn this post about the Super Bowl into a post about cycling.</p>

<p>Maybe this whole doping issue is here to turn us from our own selfishness to see that we have not as yet realized that the bicycle and bicycle racing has a purpose and meaning we have yet to even think about or care to understand. I think we are missing the real reality of what we have in the bicycle and in the racing of it.</p>

<p>Most of you are living it as well, but after four snow days in a row, having gotten out once since Monday (and Monday I went on a mountain bike ride in regular shorts and jersey) and then only to get <a href='http://twitpic.com/3w60vp'>my tire fixed</a> and re-stock on milk and beer&#8230;well, I&#8217;m over it. I am normally a fan of colder weather but the bike being a rare refuge of late, Texans in general&#8211;and specifically civically&#8211;unprepared for such conditions and 7-year-olds being particularly prone to the more annoying strains of cabin fever have all taken their toll.</p>

<p><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5060/5417115985_4ae612d9bd.jpg' alt='The fire' /></p>

<p>Last night when the snow started to fall about midnight I kind of resigned to it all. And today our good friend and neighbor Brix had another one of his famous impromptu front porch fetes. Standing by a fire with a beer and a cigar as big flakes continued to fall throughout the afternoon, it wasn&#8217;t so bad. The sun even came out. For about 15 minutes.</p>

<p><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5220/5417116055_905384a83b.jpg' alt='Penn' /></p>

<p>Ringo, of course, <strong>loves</strong> it. He&#8217;s the Kenneth Parcell of our family.</p>

<p class='date'>February 04, 2011</p><p class='postscript'>I miss her so much. I couldn't stop thinking about how much she would have loved the snow. How much better all this time stuck inside would have been, stuck inside with her.</p>]]>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how my depression has been getting worse. How I have been considering chemical interventions for it. How I remembered how the last time I required anti-depressants it was quite a few months after an event I had to pretty much eradicate from my memory. How I&#8217;m riding my bicycle a whole lot these days trying to beat it off with naturally enhanced endorphins and serotonin and norepinephrine or whatever making yourself hurt on a bicycle does that makes you forget everything and occasionally overly verbose about not much in particular.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how my day job has come to an end and I&#8217;m trying to figure out what to do next. How I&#8217;m working on a new project that has blown past all attempts to deadline it. How I&#8217;m scared shitless to pursue that thing full time because I&#8217;m afraid it will be an abject failure. How I don&#8217;t know if I even want to work right now except that funds are down after the medical bills and the property taxes and the etc.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how I don&#8217;t know where that property tax bill went. How I don&#8217;t remember seeing it cross my desk. How hard it is to do normal shit these days.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how this morning on my drive to a morning group ride my trunk lid came loose and I had to pull over into a parking lot of an empty little office building on the I-30 service road just east of Grand. The same god damn parking lot that I pulled over into the day we were told she was probably not going to make it, and I couldn&#8217;t drive any more because I was losing my shit. And this morning I had to pull into that same parking lot because of my god damn trunk lid, and when I came to a stop instead of balling and balling and begging God and begging God I just cursed at him. I cursed at him like Cee Lo Green except without melody and with a lot more anger and bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how two people total have downloaded my last record in the 6 days since I released it and how that&#8217;s about 0.3% of my Twitter followers alone. And one of those people is my Mom, who isn&#8217;t on Twitter anyway.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about what a fine cook my wife is and about the homemade veggie red curry she made tonight and the friends we had over and whose company we enjoyed.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about the mean strangers on the internet who probably thought I wouldn&#8217;t read their comments about me and about this blog and about how <em>stupid</em> it was that I had <a href='http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html'>not consulted</a> them about how best to grieve. <em>&#8220;What Daniel needs to do is&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about all the failed attempts my brain has made at creating some semblance of a tautology for this thing. How none of my experience or faith or culture has provided any tools for dealing with it. How they have only provided frameworks that crumble under its weight, pain for their attempts at grace, crumbling ruins for their attempts at meaning.</p>

<p>&#8230;but I don&#8217;t really feel like it.</p>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<p class='media'><object data='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3895428586/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' type='text/html' height='410' width='300'> </object></p>
<p>In 2003 I lived in Bosnia for a few months and while there recorded a little four-song EP, the <em>Americana EP</em>. I was really proud of it, it was my first time working with a producer and it was my first project since 1997. I&#8217;ll have to &#8220;re-print&#8221; the epic story of the Bosnian disc reproduction <em>mofiasco</em> on here soon for those who haven&#8217;t already heard it.</p>

<p>After the first <em><a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/happy-sounding-sad-songs'>Happy Sounding Sad Songs</a></em> sessions I wasn&#8217;t quite happy with the collection. There were a few songs on it that sounded like they belonged more with the previous <em>Americana EP</em> than with the rest of their companions on <em>HSSS</em>. I tabled those three, recorded two new ones <em>(<a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/i-dont-know-what-to-do-about-that' title='I Don&apos;t Know What to do About That'>IDKWTDAT</a> &amp; <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/clich]'>Clich&#233;</a>)</em>, and that was that.</p>

<p>I had it in my mind to re-work <em>Americana</em> since then. The original EP only used sampled drums and on a couple of the songs they sounded, well, sampled. I wanted real drums on those, combine them with the 3 stragglers from <em>HSSS</em>, ignore the fact that someone without a career has no place releasing a B-sides compilation, and whammo: new record.</p>

<p>Well it took a while to get around to re-working those old tracks. I had to find a studio that could import them. Then we discovered my producer back in Sarajevo had made a mistake with the backups, and I was missing most of one of the songs. We worked on the other three, adding new guitars and drums and some keys. We mixed more professionally. I mashed-up a little ending for <em>Closed</em> that harkens forward to the (now-past) remake of <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/american-dream-town'><em>Dream Town</em> on <em>HSSS</em></a>. I ended up throwing out one more song.</p>

<p>Anyway, everything was ready to go last summer. Then some stuff happened.</p>

<p>Anyway, here it is.</p>

<p>Album notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>American Dream Town</strong><br /><em>A song about secret societies, plastic surgery and other curious aspects of the American Dream.</em><br />Daniel Miller: acoustic guitar, vocals<br />Elvis Srsan: synth bass, hammond, vocals<br />Tom Bridwell: drums<br />Chris Holt: electric guitar</p>

</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Black Eye&#8217;d Kind of Love</strong><br /><em>I&#8217;ve always been pleased about how many details of the story I was able to tell in this song with such a relative economy of words.

</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Prayin&#8217; for You</strong><br /><em>&#8220;No one can keep you down when your heart is already on the ground.&#8221;</em><br />Daniel Miller: guitars, drums, vocals<br />Salim Nourallah: bass<br />Michele Pittenger: vocals</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Closed for the Year</strong><br /><em>A song about an imaginary place where capitalism has no effect.

</li>

<p><em>Numb Us</em>, <em>Black Eye&#8217;d Kind of Love</em> and <em>Prayin&#8217; for You</em> produced and recorded by Salim Nourallah and mixed by Rip Rowan at Pleasantry Lane studios, Dallas, Texas in 2006 and 2007.</p>

<p>Additional recording for <em>American Dream Town</em> and <em>Closed for the Year</em> by Tom Bridwell and mixed by Paul Williams at Tomcast Studios, Dallas, Texas in 2010.</p>

<p>Saturday night the news of the day was still being processed and Carissa and I had a date which included experiencing a set of music that did amazing things the likes of which I had not seen in a long time. It seemed as if maybe God was still with us.</p>

<p>Sunday the Texas weather changed, snow fell from the sky. And story after story of the shooting was published. Some of these stories have been about conservative rhetoric, others about gun laws. While the former subject is merely a frustrating annoyance, the latter can really tear me apart. It is clear to me that we as a society have lost our right to bear arms. I&#8217;ve heard all the arguments to the contrary and they are all absurd.</p>

<p>It seems like I shouldn&#8217;t have to explain that I am more sensitive to the subject of death. But it does seem like I need to explain that these objects, that our country&#8217;s founders protected as life-sustaining and revolutionary, have become fetish objects. And if you fetishize a gun, you fetishize death. You mock life. You deny loss.</p>

<p>But I did not start this post to say that.</p>

<p>Yesterday I found out about some even more disturbing news (even though it happened over a week ago). It&#8217;s so disturbing that I&#8217;m not going to share a link. Part of the reason it was so was because it was so true. So honest. Part of what I read was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe a God who operates by those rules does exist. If so, fuck Him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there is a God I hope he is with the person who wrote that, showing him justice and comfort.</p>

<p>Saturday night&#8217;s God feels very far away.</p>

<p>I guess I&#8217;m hoping getting this out might make a call for better weather.</p>

      <![CDATA[<img title='Not exactly what I&apos;m describing in this post, but I really like this photo Carissa took at the velodrome in Frisco http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/1423220549/' src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1377/1423220549_7dfd4e89e7_o.jpg' />
<p>There&#8217;s a corner being turned. The temperature is dropping. Various projects are progressing apace. <a href='http://carissabyers.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-years.html'>My wife said it well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My goals for 2011 are to take everyone by the hand and march us all left, right, left, right, forward, quickly, eyes open for opportunity and minds open for peace. I wish for everyone personal growth in relationships and careers and health and blessings on all people. May you all be filled with real strength and love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Carissa is an amazingly strong person for whom I am very grateful. I could not navigate these waters without her. I&#8217;m also attracted to her each day more than the last. I don&#8217;t have a lot of relationship advice to give, but I think that&#8217;s the way this thing called love is supposed to work.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;when people are truly sinking&#8230;they have no idea what mix of character, connections and dumb luck will be enough to pull through</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reading <em><a href='http://nyti.ms/hBgUlt'>On Road to Recovery, Past Adversity Provides a Map</a></em> I thought about all the difficult times we&#8217;ve both had prior to being together. In this, the most difficult search for meaning, it might be thought that those past hardships were to prepare us for this. Or it could just be, as she put it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;this is the era where everyone around me has had enough time to create something important. Celebrations are more meaningful and loss is more profound because in either direction there is such investment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any case, to consider all this random and meaningless, while valid, is a path to madness.</p>
<hr />
<p>I recently started riding my bike a bit more. I got sick of my gut hanging over my belt. Counting calories has once again become a habit. Riding is the only way to keep those calories in the negative enough to really make a difference. I need to drink less too. I&#8217;m trying.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.rapha.cc/the-rapha-festive-500'>Rapha has provided some motivation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Riding hard at Christmas is not a paradox. As you stuff your belly with food and soak yourself with booze, the roads may seem empty. But they aren&#8217;t. This year, riders across the globe will be squeezing themselves like oversized elves into tights and overshoes and heading out to go the distance, leaving the turbo trainer in the garage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My goal was to do half of the Rapha 500. I got to maybe 200k instead. But I went on the longest ride I&#8217;d done since the 90&#8217;s. I rode more days than I had in any given week since the 90&#8217;s. I&#8217;m noticeably faster now than I was two weeks before Christmas. I haven&#8217;t lost any weight. But when I&#8217;m on my bicycle my mind clears and fills with good ideas and sometimes, even, a little hope. I still miss good opportunities to ride, but I&#8217;m getting better about not letting those pass me by.</p>

<p>Guiding a well built bicycle through a turn at speed is one of the most enjoyable things a man can do. If practiced, there becomes a sequence trained into the body that makes it feel as if it has joined with the machine beneath it, one entity with one mind. There is a cadence to the movements: the shifting of weight on the saddle and then on the pedals, the eyes&#8217; line moves further ahead, then the body initiates the turn and the bicycle obeys.</p>

<p>It is starting to feel like the first beats of that cadence.</p>
<p class='date'>January 09, 2011</p><p class='postscript'>While I have not splurged for any Rapha clothing, they do help <a href='http://www.velodramatic.com/archives/6266'>perpetuate an aesthetic</a> that accentuates all the things I've loved about cycling. It is, after all, one of the most beautiful sports in the world. It should be no surprise that so many designers are drawn to it.<br /><br /><object height='270' width='480'><param name='allowfullscreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><param name='movie' value='http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=15197531&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0' /><embed src='http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=15197531&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0' allowfullscreen='true' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' height='270' width='480' /></object></p>]]>

<p>I hope at this point anyone in Dallas reading this blog knows about <a href='http://www.dallasobserver.com/2011-01-06/music/remembering-frankie-45/'>what happened in our community</a> this week.

I only knew Frankie and only know Frank from seeing them at the Kettle gallery and Dada. Obviously I now feel connected to Frank. I don&#8217;t know what else to say about this, or how to possibly reach out to him. The place he now inhabits, and will be, where I still am, it is indescribable and unknowable and unique for each person within it.</p>

<p>Last December <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/dealingwith/status/14823407203913728'>I paid Dave Pell a compliment on Twitter</a> and he replied &#8220;<a href='http://twitter.com/#!/davepell/status/14852545004437504'>Learning a lot from your blog</a>.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Uh oh, which blog?&#8221; and asked him as much in a direct message. Twitter gave way to email and he asked if he could use material from my post <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/11/29/connected.html'>&#8220;The Infinitely Connected Triggers of Her Memory and the Dumb Machines of the Technopathocracy.&#8221;</a> Dave starts his piece:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think about a lot of things before I share online. But here&#8217;s one thing I never think about:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The unthinkable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dave is an amazing writer already featured on NPR (among others), and <a href='http://tweetagewasteland.com/2011/01/you-cant-turn-off-the-machine/'>the things he wrote around the context of my post were both sensitive and thought provoking</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Daniel can&#8217;t escape his own digital trail. Yet he returns to the internet to add to it. He is using the machine to express his frustration that the machine won&#8217;t leave him alone. The same technology that haunts him also provides a way to mourn and remember.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;The acts of communication, sharing and remembering online are similar to their counterparts in our offline lives, but they&#8217;re not the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;We haven&#8217;t had a chance to reflect on the role this technology is playing in our lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is all a subject matter I&#8217;ve been interested in for a long time. In my original post I use the term <em>technopathology</em>, a term I first encountered in the Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka Hakim Bey) video I included in <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/10/28/isolation.html'>this post</a> (he coined the term). I&#8217;ve been a long-time fan of Wilson&#8217;s writings (ask anyone who&#8217;s been around when I start referencing his essay on <a href='http://books.google.com/books?id=FlKN__HHPTMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=L760-c6-yS&amp;dq=hakim%20bey%20immediatism&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false'>Immediatism</a>) but I&#8217;m not as radical in my rejection of technologies as he. As Dave says, this is the world we live in&#8211;and I read that a little more literally as a technologist who makes his living (and spends most of his time, besides) in front of just such a machine. But to think about this system as &#8220;the rule of sick machines&#8221; is helpful when trying to diagnose these illnesses we&#8217;ve developed due to our unblinking acceptance of various technologies into our lives.</p>

<p>I wrote about this topic years ago for Movement magazine in the UK:</p>
<blockquote style='font-style:normal'>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really so lapsarian. Like Doctorow and Sterling, I believe more in a singularity than an apocalypse.<br /><br />&ldquo;...technology allows a boolean-packet level quantification of not new behaviors, but ways-of-being that predate history. A simple way to explore what the web was really teaching us was to imagine a world born with that knowledge but devoid of the cognition-obliterating information overload that the tools engender. What kind of slow death constraints would bring focus to the real breakthroughs of modern life? A web without servers? Markets without cash or stocks? A regression, sure, but not a dark ages. An enlightened regression.&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>From 2008&#8217;s <em><a href='http://danielsjourney.com/files/Movement_130_20-21.pdf'>The Antipocalypse: Documentation</a></em>, the last of the three-part <em>Antipocalypse</em> series. If you have an interest in clicking through, you might start with <a href='http://www.danielsjourney.com/files/Daniel%20Miller%20-%20The%20Antipocalypse.pdf'>Part 1</a> and <a href='http://www.danielsjourney.com/files/JohnnyCitizen_Antipoc1_1.pdf'>Part 1.1</a>. So nerdy with my numbering.</p>

<p>It took a while for her to show up in my dreams, but apparently it&#8217;s started. Last night I had a dream that we were having a party and she was there, and I was <strong>so</strong> happy and just held her and nuzzled her and she giggled that amazing giggle and was soft and perfect and beautiful and happy like always. I kept saying, &#8220;She&#8217;s back! She&#8217;s back!&#8221; in between big facefulls of her stomach and back and thighs.</p>

<p>I had to hand her off to Carissa and I was moving towards the door when my grandfather walked in. My confusion turned to comfort and he just sauntered in like he&#8217;d been there a hundred times. I said to whoever was standing next to me at the time, &#8220;There are dead people at my party and it&#8217;s making me happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dream didn&#8217;t really bother me when I first woke up, but its effects seem to be lingering. I&#8217;m not sure if writing this post is going to help or not. I&#8217;m trying to take it as a comfort. I probably just need to go ride my bike and then get focused on something else.</p>
