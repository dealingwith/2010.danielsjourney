<p>It would seem the heat is driving everyone insane. For a while we were kept excited about breaking the 100&deg; consecutive-day record. Then we had one 98&deg; day and fell short by a few days. The worst thing you can offer a hopeless society is a short moment of hope. It then returned to 100+ degree temps and we all just got quiet and stopped discussing it and all started acting a little insane. Our driving skills diminished. Our irritability increased. Our general sense of hope and well being decreased&hellip;</p>

<p>And so a new morning arrived. And I rode 55 miles, in the company of people I enjoy, <a href="http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/mVQYeo7T-tg">40 of which were on roads I&rsquo;d never seen before</a> and were rather nice for cycling. Some of them even reminded me of the roads I grew up riding on in PA. It was the perfect way to start a new year.</p>

<hr>


<p>At first I thought Lucy&rsquo;s conception would change something. Then the year mark. Of course things never work that way. This will stay with me forever. How I live within it changes. I wish I could be to the place where I could see her pictures. I didn&rsquo;t expect to yet be to the place where I could watch video or listen to the audio I&rsquo;d captured of her talking and singing. But I had hoped to be able to see her beautiful, perfect face, not fear seeing it for risk of losing my shit.</p>

<hr>


<p>I had more to say but have run out of time multiple times. Thank you all for your well-portioned reaching-outs yesterday. So for now, a small mix.</p>

<p>Yesterday improved. My meeting went really well and then I took the opportunity to visit my new friend Gerhard in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Roanoke,+tx">Roanoke</a>. Gerhard is the person I vaguely mentioned <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/08/03/get-over-yourself.html">in the footnote of this post</a> and the story is long and important and I don&rsquo;t want to do it injustice so I&rsquo;m not going to attempt to tell it right now.</p>

<p>Had a cigar, talked about life, <a href="http://mlkshk.com/p/5ZM5">ate too much</a>, drank delicious German beer. Soul restorage.</p>

<p>This morning I had to get up and get downtown to appear in court for a ticket I got while riding my bike around White Rock Lake. The Dallas Police enjoy hiding out near the stop signs on the roads cyclist frequent, especially on the weekend when they know they will be able to pick off rider after rider rolling through stop signs. Fortunately my case was dismissed.</p>

<p>365 days ago I woke up from the first of a number of nights sleeping in the ICU.</p>

<p>Today I&rsquo;m just trying to find some focus. I have client meetings today and tomorrow. I have two huge deliverables in the next five days. I&rsquo;ve only ridden my bike twice in the last five days.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s hard.</p>

    <summary>The Chemistry Set - Love (Dance on the one that brought you) I used to define my life in terms...</summary>
    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<p class="media"><span class="audioplayer"><span id="audioplayer_1"><a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/ChemSet/05%20Love%20(Dance%20on%20the%20one%20that%20brought%20you).mp3">The Chemistry Set - Love (Dance on the one that brought you)</a></span></span></p>


<p>I used to define my life in terms of before and after certain relationships. But the one that lasted from 2009 to 2010 has trumped everything and defined my life into a binary before/after that makes all others simply lumped into one amorphous before.</p>

<p><a name="a"></a>But that time from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJXiL-DPxbE">late 2007</a> to 2010 was a magical journey through love and contentment and family and fatherhood that I will always cherish&mdash;and I hope to be able to return to those emotions again. {<a href="#foot_a" class="foot">1</a>}</p>

<p><a name="b"></a>Part of that time period involved <a href="http://dealingwith.wordpress.com/2008/01/12/many-thoughts-after-my-show-and-the-chemistry-set-show-last-night/">going</a> to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3kfr956">Chemistry Set</a> shows with Carissa. Yesterday I mentioned my favorite song of all time, <em>Wake Me</em> by Tom Conlon. But I might have to rate the Chemistry Set as my favorite band of all time. {<a href="#foot_b" class="foot">2</a>} &hellip;If you weren&rsquo;t following the Dallas music scene in the first decade of this century you probably never heard of the Chemistry set. But I suggest you go grab both{<a href="#foot_c" class="foot">3</a>} their records while you still can. They disbanded a few years ago.</p>

<p><a name="c"></a>Anyway. Listening to their music still makes me feel better. I miss them terribly. Carissa shot their drummer&rsquo;s wedding and we&rsquo;re still friends with them{<a href="#foot_d" class="foot">4</a>} (sadly they&rsquo;re in Fort Worth which might as well be California). We never knew any of the other band members although I think we both had a crush on Stephen Duncan.</p>

<p class="date">August 03, 2011</p>




<p class="postscript"><a name="foot_a">1</a> Obviously I feel them still. I guess I mean to be immersed in them in such a way as to be more fully engulfed in the moment and reality of current joy as opposed to allowing everything to be tainted by past loss. {<a href="#a" class="foot">back</a>}<br>
<br>
<a name="foot_b">2</a> It is my personal opinion that one should choose &ldquo;all time&rdquo; rankings based on one&rsquo;s own experience as well as allow the rankings to be as flexible as a moment&rsquo;s inspiration. Otherwise everyone&rsquo;s all time band would just be The Beatles and there would be nothing else interesting to talk about. {<a href="#b" class="foot">back</a>}<br>
<br>
<a name="foot_c">3</a> Here is <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/chemistryset2">Blue Monsters</a>. Good luck finding their debut. If you contact me I will probably hook you up, though. {<a href="#b" class="foot">back</a>}<br>

    <summary>Tom Conlon - Wake Me Some days I feel like I need a shirt that says: "I lost my daughter....</summary>

      <![CDATA[<p class="media"><span class="audioplayer"><span id="audioplayer_1"><a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/11%20Wake%20Me.mp3">Tom Conlon - Wake Me</a></span></span></p>


<p>Some days I feel like I need a shirt that says: &ldquo;I lost my daughter. Get over yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<hr>


<p>Today was a bad day. It&rsquo;s a bad month to have a bad month if you know what I mean. The constant effing heat (30-some days over 100 degrees and no end in sight) combined with a ridiculous workload mean very little riding or time for sanity resets (of which riding was my primary).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still having to deal with the cemetery because Margot&rsquo;s headstone is still not done. My handler there is very nice but emails have failed to transfer for whatever reasons and it takes me weeks to return normal phone calls yet alone these. The font I originally chose (Helvetica) was too big to fit even though we chose no additional text. Today I just went by there because I was nearby and knew that was going to be the quickest way to keep this god damned process moving forward. They had at least given me two options that were the closest and would fit. I picked something-gothic.</p>

<p>It was a quick stop but I still found myself wrecked afterward&mdash;and headed to work. This song by my friend Tom Conlon left me sobbing as I drove down <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3rnm3sb">I75</a>. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it is probably my favorite song of all time. But the longing it conveys is so much more intense now. That this current life is but a dream that leads to the reality of the next should be some comfort to me* &hellip;Her wait for me is like a day. My wait is my lifetime.</p>

<p>A lifetime of longing. The emotions all came to the front. It happens in the car so much more frequently than anywhere else.</p>

<hr>


<p>Then on the way home from work I stopped by Whole Foods for Necessary Supplies (for Frito-pie and <a href="http://www.deschutesbrewery.com/brew/inversion-ipa">sanity</a>) and for whatever reason it was filled with beautiful 1-2 year old girls. One right at the entrance who was obviously as full of wonder and joy at life as Margot was. Another played with the offerings in the open chiller in the first isle. Your boys aren&rsquo;t much trouble, your newborns even I can handle. But your 1 year old girls punch me in the chest, penetrate my ribcage and squeeze my heart until it bruises.</p>

<p class="postscript">* maaan I have an entire post about this subject and a man I met about a month ago who was like a prophet to me. So far it has been too much to try and process in written words.

<p>Ezra Caldwell* posted an intimate and important** <a href="http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/?p=702">post</a> that I want to both capture for my future reference and share with you:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sitting there on the water I began to talk myself into a state of utter self loathing&hellip;An hour later, though, I found myself in a little sleeping cabin apart from the house, curled up in the fetal position completely catatonic. My mind was racing, and none of it good. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine how, for instance, how I was going to be able to get back to NYC. (&ldquo;Drive the rental car, you fool!&rdquo; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t possibly! I might drive it off the road and kill my wife in a state of self distructive insanity!&rdquo;)&hellip;</p>

<p>From somewhere far back in my head, I watched myself go crazy.  There was a part of me in there that found the whole thing fascinating.  A part of me that was saying, &ldquo;Ok Ezra&hellip;snap out of it. This is nonsense.&rdquo; Intellectually I was able to recognize that what was going on was madness and yet I couldn&rsquo;t stop the waves of very real emotions that were overwhelming me.</p>

<p>I had lost <em>all</em> confidence. The swagger and cockiness that held me together for the last 3 years simply vanished. I guess I had been waiting for that to happen&hellip;I was forced to recognize that without the arrogance, the thing that I really hate about myself, I simply fell apart. (I realize now, that I have about three years of justifiable falling apart to catch up on!)</p>

<p>Hill had been napping inside, and came out to find me. I couldn&lsquo;t even speak. I managed finally to say, &ldquo;Baby&hellip;I&rsquo;m in serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Special Ed brought a bottle of bourbon out and helped me talk my way back to earth. I went inside and cooked dinner.</p></blockquote>

<hr>


<p>My friend and producer Salim Nourallah has a new record coming out this summer. Be on the lookout for it. This tune crossed my desk about the same time as Ezra&rsquo;s post and seemed to just fit. Had a stressful day today, but it&rsquo;s odd how not-really-stressful &ldquo;normal&rdquo; stress is to me now.

<p class="no-caps">July 22nd</p>


<ul>
<li>Woke up at 6 and chatted with my brother-in-law Dale. I was up to go on a bike ride while it was under 100 degrees and Dale was up to study for his CPA exam.</li>
<li>Went on a 1.5 hour mountain bike ride around the trails on the property we&rsquo;re staying on and the dirt roads of the area. Was chased by two different dogs. Rode a number of hills larger than what we call hills in Dallas.</li>
<li>Ran variations on the Marine-standard obstacle course installed on the property with Dale, Penn and my nephews Cade and Cody. Invented a leg-burning timed run that was a big hit.</li>
<li>Went on a 30 minute walk and chatted with my sister Jan.</li>
<li>Played a relatively epic game of hide-and-seek involving a decent amount of running for at least 30 minutes after dinner.</li>
<li>Did not drink.</li>
<li>Still went over my daily calorie allowance.</li>
</ul>

<p>July 23rd</p>

<ul>
<li>Woke up at 6:15 and chatted with my brother in law again (this time about Macs).</li>
<li>Rode about about 1 hour 40. The hills here are bigger and more frequent that in Dallas which is nice until you get tired. They&rsquo;re really more like big rollers but throw in a brisk south headwind and I&rsquo;m feeling it a bit now. Chased by three dogs this time. Actually one of those times it was a pack of 3 or 4 dogs&mdash;fortunately I was traveling north at the time so I was moving pretty fast thanks to the tailwind. Besides the dogs, though, it is really nice to be riding out in the country with better views, cleaner air and fewer cars.</li>
<li>Went swimming in the pond. I had to talk myself into it but once I was in the water I was so glad I had. Fun!</li>
<li>Napped for 2 hours.</li>
</ul>


<p>Today looms. Margot would have been two years old today. When I said my riding is a shelter from her loss I was generalizing. I thought a lot about her on my ride today. After the pack of chasing dogs it was a bit of a relief to have my mind occupied with looking out for the next canine threat.</p>

<p>But God I just miss her so much. And I wish we could eradicate certain words from our vocabulary. And I wish you all were as raw as I am still so that when you said those words you felt that sting of pain. And I wish today would finally have come and gone for one more year. And I wish this family vacation didn&rsquo;t remind me so much of last year&rsquo;s family vacation, when she was there.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rode the mountain bike just around the property so as to avoid dogs. Got chased by neighbor&rsquo;s dogs anyway.</li>
<li>Walked and swam. I think the swimming is working new muscles in my arms and legs. Good thing.</li>
<li>Power napped.</li>
<li>Extended family came today and we rather enjoyed their visit after the days of just immediate family.</li>
</ul>

<p>July 25th</p>

<p>Woke up a little later than usual (a little before 6:30) to the sight of a wet driveway. The temperature was below 80 and while the humidity was high, it was a miracle. I decided to head out on the wet roads and not wait another minute to see if the sun came out to dry them. In fact I was hopeful that the clouds would remain for the duration of the ride, which they did.</p>

<p>It was&mdash;despite being chased by dogs three or four times*&mdash;my favorite ride of the year. It reminded me of riding in Pennsylvania when I was a teenager. It&rsquo;s not hard to understand how I became attracted to the sport. I&rsquo;ve been riding in the city for so long now that it actually took some time for me to adjust being out on an empty road, all by myself, with no other roads in sight. It&rsquo;s an introvert&rsquo;s perfect activity.</p>

<p>I was tentatively planning on riding about 50-60 miles but after making a wrong turn and diverting from my original route by five miles I improved a loop back and ended up with just a hair over 40.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dealingwith/5981716365/" title="photo by dealingwith, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6028/5981716365_1af1dcb304.jpg" width="500" height="374" alt="photo"></a></p>

<p>Later that day we went to the <a href="http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/">National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum</a> which was surprisingly awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dealingwith/5982277200/" title="photo by dealingwith, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6001/5982277200_ab89c7bbfe.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="photo"></a></p>

<p>After that we had a traditional family dinner at <a href="http://johnniesok.com/johnnies.php">Johnnie&rsquo;s</a>, then a birthday get-together for &ldquo;aunt&rdquo; Virginia, who is 94 and as healthy as I am at least.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6129/5981695675_dd1907c58d_b.jpg" style="float:right;"></p>

<p class="postscript">* ...and even changing course once when I saw a giant loose German Shepard up the road--the road I diverted onto was the best of the ride. The best chase was a pair of terriers who never got closer than a few feet from me despite the fact I was climbing and going plenty slow. They followed me so far up that road I started to deviously wonder if I could lead them so far away they wouldn't be able to find their way home.</p>

<p>As Lucy&rsquo;s presence becomes more real (we had another sonogram yesterday and she&rsquo;s healthy and moved a little bit for us while we watched in awe) I am forced to face the coming reality that there will be another beautiful girl in our house at the same time I will still (always) feel the loss of my first child. Even as I contemplated names this morning I thought, &ldquo;&lsquo;Margot Rose Miller&rsquo; was the perfect name. You can&rsquo;t top that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have any weird expectations on Lucy. But the part of my soul that needs this all to be woven into a mystical, meaningful narrative wants to feel like both Margot and Lucy are special and ordained, each with a place and purpose, things that from my perspective will always be linked.</p>

<p>Margot was already such an important person, not just because she was as beautiful and perfect as a baby can be. Margot was a miracle, she was redemption, she was the fulfillment of a decade&rsquo;s worth of desire&hellip;and that was only in her being. As she grew she became <a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/08/glue.html">exceptional</a> in even more, unexpected ways.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/5954520607/" title="Lucy is 9 inches tall and the placenta previa is now just &quot;low lying.&quot; excellent news all around! by carissabyers, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6028/5954520607_a8cc8ee16c.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="Lucy is 9 inches tall and the placenta previa is now just &quot;low lying.&quot; excellent news all around!"></a></p>

<p>Lucy is somehow part of the answer to the question that will never be answered completely.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lucy, tell me the truth, &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m in love with you.</p></blockquote>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/fat-cyclist.jpg" title="fat cyclist"></p>

<p>While it is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dealingwith/status/92007355289567233">very hot outside</a>, this does not give you license to ride your bike shirtless. The only males who are allowed to bicycle shirtless are surfers and other drunk <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/fat%20shirtless%20bicyclist/nollpost/mrnspace/fat%20guys%20on%20bikes/Florida100.jpg">beachgoers</a>. (Women, in general, are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=topless%20bicyclist">excused from this rule</a>, yet almost never break it.) Despite your proximity to water, there are no beaches at White Rock Lake. In fact, Dallas is what we refer to as &ldquo;landlocked&rdquo; in that the nearest beach is a five hour drive by motorcar. This rule applies to all men but even more so to fat men. It also applies to the adiposely-advanced runner. No one wants to see even the smallest of man-boobs bounce. Further, wearing only a heart rate monitor above the waist is evidence of even more severe social impairment and grounds for institutionalization.</p>

<p>Additionally, in cold weather, please never wear a sleeveless jersey and arm warmers. In fact, sleeveless athletic wear should be left to women and weight lifters.</p>

<p>Triathletes and those who bought and installed triathlete handlebar extensions for the road bicycle they dust off once every eight Saturdays: I would wish bad things to happen to you while you are using said handlebars but the likelihood of said bad things happening increases so much when you use said handlebars that I don&rsquo;t really have to wish it at all. The problem is when your absurd and unsafe riding position comes within a certain distance to my own attempts at safe, reasonable bicycling. You&rsquo;re a hazard. If you are really training for a competitive time trial, drive yourself and your fancy bike out to a long, flat, straight piece of road without other cyclists on it and practice there. If you&rsquo;re not training for a competitive time trial, then you are a complete dork.</p>

<p>Runners: while I admit my frustration with your presence and bewilderment at your choice of exercise modalities may be mirrored by your own feelings toward my bicycling, I do somewhat resent the way you can dominate a mixed-use trail like so many ants on a discarded picnic hotdog. I imagine drivers must feel the same way when stuck behind a large group ride out on the street, but at least they have air conditioning and a radio to enjoy while they wait for a moment to pass. Also, there are not 1000 large group rides all over Dallas every weekend morning.</p>

<p>Bicyclists with earbuds: there are very few times when earbuds are acceptable, mostly for reasons of your own safety. However, if you are going to be around even just a small number of other cyclists, they are unacceptable. I know music can motivate you to pedal and allow the time to pass with a bit more ease. However if you cannot hear the music in the act of bicycling, then you are missing an essential piece of the cycling aesthetic that is required to truly excel at its execution.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22444962?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="499" height="281" frameborder="0" style="margin-bottom:1.5em;"></iframe>


<p>Police officers: if you really cared about safety on the mixed-use trails and roads around White Rock Lake you would institute speed limits and ban earbuds for both runners and cyclists. You would not camp out near stop signs in order to write tickets with as much efficiency and speed as possible. You would also not blow through a stop sign at top speed in order to catch up to and admonish cyclists for rolling through a stop sign at a slow speed.</p>

<p>To those addressed in the above paragraphs, thank you for your consideration of these simple rules. Much like covering your mouth when you cough, not speaking with your mouth full, not staring at strangers, parking between the lines, putting trash in the appropriate receptacles and not talking through a movie or concert, these simple rules can allow us all to coexist in more harmony.</p>

<p>You might have noticed a gradually increasing dearth of posts around here. I&rsquo;ve been busy. <a href="http://extrasauce.com">Work</a> has been (lately, very) busy and, I dare say, enjoyable. I&rsquo;ve had the amazing luck to have gone from one amazing team (Collecta&mdash;where I was for the last two years) to yet another. I cannot hide my excitement about the group of people I&rsquo;ve found myself surrounded by at Extra Sauce and I must confess a somewhat disturbing affection* for my coworkers. I have a good feeling about this one.</p>

<p>I recently had the realization that no day will ever go by that I don&rsquo;t think about Margot. That no day will ever go by without between 10 and 50 things that trigger her memory, or the memory of losing her, or the reality of the loss I now reside in. And in that realization I became ok with it. The thought sounded something like this: &ldquo;&hellip;and that&rsquo;s ok.&rdquo; This is my reality. This is the rest of my life. I&rsquo;m not sure how this has changed me long term. I&rsquo;m not even sure if it&rsquo;s a burden or a freedom; maybe it is somehow both. But the simple acceptance of its permanence felt like a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>(Warning: TMI paragraph.) Been riding my ass off. Literally. Each of the last two Sundays I&rsquo;ve returned from a 50 mile ride with skin missing from my backside. Not saddle sores (I worked through those earlier this year), but where the sweat&mdash;created in greater quantities in the 90-100&deg; heat and evaporating more slowly in the high humidity&mdash;pools. That is probably the worst part of the summer training. There is also the severe cramping afterwards and the slower recovery time. Still, I thought I was going to give up when it got above 90 and I&rsquo;m still, somehow, cramming the miles in week after week. It&rsquo;s more important for my sanity than, for example, this blog. It&rsquo;s more important for my sanity than just about anything, which is probably what&rsquo;s keeping me on the bike despite the misery of the Texas summer.</p>

<hr>


<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on this blog that I was considering antidepressants and that I&rsquo;d used them in the past with (limited) success. Well I finally, at the recommendation of my therapist, saw a psychiatrist and started on some antidepressants. They had their expected (and previously experienced) side effects and their desired clinical effects were negligible. I was just about to give up when he recommended an additional drug. Maybe I was desperate. Maybe I was led. Whichever the case, this thing has been amazing. I&rsquo;ve never been so focused, motivated or full of energy before. Even my thoughts improved (obviously this is related to focus, but nevertheless). I&rsquo;m not going to say what this new drug is, but let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;ve probably seen a commercial for it on TV. Last weekend I said to a friend, &ldquo;I hate being a [drug] commercial!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In case this blog is your <em>only</em> interaction with my life (given my infrequency of posts you should really follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/dealingwith">Twitter</a>), we found out our new baby is a girl. I had only come to terms with the fact it could be a boy about 10 seconds prior to the sonogram tech telling us it is a girl. <em>Lucy</em>. (Middle name is either <em>Pearl</em> or <em>Rae</em>&hellip;please chime in with your choice.) It&rsquo;s hard to think about Lucy when I still miss Margot so much, and everything baby-related (clothes, products, etc) makes me think of the past, not the future. Still, I can&rsquo;t help but think that there must be something really special about Lucy. Might not be just any ol' angel charged with her wellbeing.</p>

<hr>


<p>The song embedded at the top of this post is by my friend <a href="http://www.andyzipf.com/">Andy Zipf</a>** who has a new record out (<em>I Ain&rsquo;t the Kind for Givin' Up</em> is the opening track) that you can <a href="http://andyzipf.spinshop.com/">download for free right now</a>. I recommend you do. I&rsquo;ve been consuming a lot of music lately (and writing none&mdash;a post for another day, perhaps) and so often a song falls into that <em>10 to 50 things a day</em> I mentioned. But sometimes a song just is, or just fits, or just helps. I was happy to discover this to be the first track on a friend&rsquo;s new album. It meant something.</p>

<p>Sun Lux&rsquo;s new record <em>We Are Rising</em> is a must have. It&rsquo;s blowing my mind more with every listen. There are a few songs that cut a little too close to the bone, and those I must skip. But overall it is a record well described by the title. <a href="http://t.co/84FfI4Q">Go get it here</a> or <a href="http://music.sonluxmusic.com/album/we-are-rising">through Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p class="postscript"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sonlux/status/86842264919359488">Ryan Lott himself replied to me on Twitter the other day</a>. I must confess I was chuffed. He was even replying to a tweet I sent <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dealingwith/status/86305338650918912">in reply to a separate conversation</a>. I don't have the heart to tell him I can't listen to <em>Flowers</em> anymore, either.

    <summary>Isn't the deal with nostalgia just that if we can live in the past, then we live before all these...</summary>

      <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3551/3540768084_d6971c7b66.jpg" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lintmachine/3540768084/ Sweep by lintmachine"></p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t the deal with nostalgia just that if we can live in the past, then we live before all these difficult and painful things that have happened to us? We live without the memories. We live in a time that was safe. Enjoyable. Innocent.</p>

<p>I think about the people on <em>Hoarders</em> and I wonder if it really doesn&rsquo;t matter what their current state is, as long as those objects they hold onto allow their minds to be somewhere else. Some kind of form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation">dissociation</a> or retrograde <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state">fugue state</a>&mdash;instead of the establishment of a new identity, there is an establishment of a prior identity.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>As I get older, and specifically throughout this experience, my desire for&mdash;or at least the elicitation of&mdash;nostalgic feelings has intensified. And they are very specific. The drum sounds in Phil Collin&rsquo;s <em>I Don&rsquo;t Care Anymore</em>&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="audioplayer"><span id="audioplayer_1"><a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/01%20I%20Don't%20Care%20Anymore.mp3">Phil Collins - I Don't Care Anymore</a></span></span></p>


<p>Or Live&rsquo;s <em>Pain Lies On The Riverside</em>&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="audioplayer"><span id="audioplayer_2"><a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/01%20Pain%20Lies%20On%20The%20Riverside.mp3">Live - Pain Lies on the Riverside</a></span></span></p>


<p>Or the look of the trees and the smell of the air along <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=6906+Pasadena+Ave,+Dallas,+Texas+75214&amp;t=h&amp;ll=32.805289,-96.728257&amp;spn=0.00271,0.005016&amp;z=18">a particular part of trail</a> cooled by the effects of the greenery and nearby water.</p>
