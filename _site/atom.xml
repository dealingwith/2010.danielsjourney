<p>I&#8217;ve said before that there are certain questions that are now &#8220;<a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/24/what-now.html'>best escorted out of the park by security</a>&#8221; &#8230;and maybe you noticed that was the first of a trilogy: &#8220;What now?&#8221; &#8220;<a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/02/28/I-can-not-go-on.html'>I&#8217;ll go on.</a>&#8221; &#8220;<a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2011/03/07/bikes.html'>Not because [I want] to but because [I have] to.</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>The problem with the deeper questions surrounding our loss and our lives is that they are the questions that have existed for all time and our answers&#8211;or lack thereof&#8211;are the same as well. The search for meaning evolves into a search to be more human, to connect to&#8211;not a Truth&#8211;but the truth of what it means to here with others.</p>

<p>So today I was reading some posts by my friend Kester Brewin and he wrote <a href='http://www.kesterbrewin.com/2011/03/15/free-will-determinism-heaven-hell/'>something that made a tiny bit of sense</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;we cannot prove if heaven and hell exist, but it&#8217;s a natural response to want the world to be fair, to be sorted out and judged at some point so that justice is done. A deterministic universe it might be&#8211;just chemicals and electrons&#8211;but this is not a world that we find &#8220;human&#8221; precisely because it makes a nonsense of ideas of love&#8211;and hate too.</p>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<img title='photo by Carissa http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/5541721448/in/set-72157626178939455/' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5091/5541721448_53e1c9a0f8.jpg' />
<p>The last week in Michigan was awesome for so many reasons. The weather was perfect. I enjoyed being out in the country. It reminded me very much of where I grew up in Pennsylvania. I enjoyed getting to know Carissa&#8217;s family more, including meeting relatives I&#8217;d never met before and seeing <a href='http://twitpic.com/4a2oe0'>where</a> Carissa&#8217;s brother and stepfather make their pizza ovens as well as <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=buchanan+mi'>where</a> they are going to have their restaurant. We had <a href='http://twitpic.com/49wt4n'>fresh roasted</a> coffee every morning, either <a href='http://twitpic.com/49x0c7'>pour-over</a> or via their new industrial <a href='http://twitpic.com/4aou8e'>espresso machine</a>. We had <a href='http://twitpic.com/4a5fwr'>home-made pizza</a> one evening, made with home-made cheese, home-made dough, washed down with locally brewed <a href='http://twitpic.com/4a50w3'>10% IPA</a> (that might have made me a little bit belligerent&#8230;oops). We went to awesome stores and to the dunes by Lake Michigan. We ate homemade <a href='http://twitpic.com/4a395a'>crepes</a> for lunch&#8230;twice. After relatively painless drives/flights back we all quickly fell asleep Friday night. Penn slept for over 12 hours that night.</p>
<hr />
<p>Saturday was a day at the velodrome for me. At the <a href='http://superdrome.com/'>Superdrome</a> here in Texas you are required to take the developmental class, which is about 4 hours long. After that you are free to ride on the track during open track times or race (assuming you also obtain a racing license). I took a track developmental class in Pennsylvania&#8230;in 1994. Last time I rode on a track was (I think) 1996.</p>

<p>The beginning of the class was a little mind-numbing but an expected and necessary evil to get onto the track. The Superdrome is <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/1423220549/in/set-72157602121750885/'>steeper</a> than anything I&#8217;d ridden before and did take some getting used to. But once open track was declared and I could take a couple laps at speed, I started to get hooked again. There is just nothing like the feel of the g-forces when really hammering through a turn on a velodrome. Especially one with turns that steep.</p>

<p>After the open track session we practiced <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCPfxsbp8Ig&amp;feature=related' title='Not at ALL as awesome as this one, but damn it is so beautiful to watch and gives you the idea'>pacelining</a> for 20 laps. Then we finished the day with a 10 lap <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_race' title='&quot;A scratch race is a cycling race in which all contestants start from scratch (on equal terms)&quot;'>scratch</a>* race, which I won! Back in 1994 I won the developmental class race, too, and I was hooked. I feel the same things now, just with the more weathered enthusiasm and caution of age.</p>

<p>Sunday, possibly inspired by Saturday&#8217;s tiny success, I rode to the morning ride in Oak Cliff, then lobbied for a longer route than normal. The combination allowed me to break the 50 mile mark for the first time in 15 or so years.</p>
<hr />
<p>While we were in Michigan I just couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about Margot. How much she would have loved it there and loved meeting her extended family and hanging out with them. There are so many things that are continuously covered with the smell of loss. Things I wanted her to experience, things I wanted to experience with her. Things that while enjoyable, were made alive in an unfathomable way for me with her there, and are now made dark with her absence.</p>

<p>When I ride I am traveling back in time. I am in a place she never inhabited. A place she couldn&#8217;t inhabit. I think that&#8217;s why I like it so much.</p>
<p class='date'>March 21, 2011</p><p class='postscript'>* I always thought it was a race <em>to</em> the scratch, or the line &ldquo;scratched&rdquo; across the track to indicate the finish line. Sounds more poetic to me.</p>]]>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<img title='from this post http://www.lagazzettadellabici.com/2011/03/photographs-from-archives.html' src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5299/5509891000_48d275bf98.jpg' />
<p>Yesterday I rode a brisk 47 miles, not the 60 mile Saturday morning training rides of 1995 Tucson, but something. Today the only time my legs forgot their pain was when I was on the bike again. That&#8217;s one of the best things about bicycling.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;m going with this blog. It&#8217;s feeling increasingly useless. I&#8217;m going to remove the link to it from my homepage because I&#8217;m getting a lot of emails from recruiters. Recruiters are hilariously coy and always require the wrong information. A friend asked the best question, &#8220;Are you ready?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Work is good.&#8221; He echoed, &#8220;Work is good!&#8221; and sort of half threw his hands in the air. This is the best we do. If we were farmers we would be planting. If we were hunters we would be hunting. Not because we wanted to but because we had to.</p>

<p>What we do is make software. And software is best made by humans who understand each other (and by extension understand the people who use their software). Unless they&#8217;re miraculously made up of such humans, organizations make shitty software. Just an observation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Penn is sitting next to me doing his homework and just declared: &#8220;Don&#8217;t give me an idea! Give me a snack!&#8221; It was completely random. Before that he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t think of bad things. Think of <strong>pancakes</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to bikes. I must confess. I spent the afternoon looking at porn. Bike porn.</p>

<p>The image to the left is from <a href='http://www.lagazzettadellabici.com/2011/03/photographs-from-archives.html'>this post</a>, which is full of pictures from pre-1990 era cycling. The era that I studied while riding and then racing in junior high and high school. I have a collection of cycling hats from that era; I&#8217;m not really sure how I got into hat collecting&#8230;they&#8217;re cheaper and take up less space than jerseys or bikes. I am pretty sure at one point I had a GiS cap. I might have worn it until it was too worn to wear or keep. But when I saw that GiS logo on that rider&#8217;s kit, I could smell my introduction to cycling. It is weird how the olfactory sense is the one most connected to memory, isn&#8217;t it? I could literally smell some combination of things I haven&#8217;t smelled in two decades, and in that brief memory was all the magic that was bike racing.</p>

<p>What probably happened was that moment released some happy chemicals in my brain and so I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to recreate that experience. In vain, of course&#8230;</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/sashae/2626635126/in/faves-dealingwith/'><img src='http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/2626635126_b860cdabfe_z.jpg' alt='GiS kit' /></a></p>

<p>But I did find this GiS jersey on Flickr. There&#8217;s also this <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/sashae/2626636076/in/faves-dealingwith/'>Ariostea jersey</a>! And it turns out <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/sashae/'>that Flickr account is some kind of magical gold mine for awesome retro (or otherwise) gear</a>&#8230;</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/sashae/2289870697/in/faves-dealingwith/'><img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2293/2289870697_f2d663f178.jpg' alt='OMG Yamaguchi' /></a></p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/pedalturista/2500148658/in/faves-dealingwith/'><img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2500148658_491c7fc0e7.jpg' alt='pink Nagasawa!' /></a></p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/sashae/4689592172/in/faves-dealingwith/'><img src='http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1300/4689592172_8619f2d3f9.jpg' alt='Spectrum!' /></a></p>

<p>What you have to understand about a <a href='http://www.spectrum-cycles.com/'>Tom Kellogg</a> bicycle is it was a bike that&#8211;at least while I was in the Leigh Valley in mid-90&#8217;s&#8211;made an immediate statement about the quality of the rider who pedaled it. I was in Tucson in the same time frame and there it was a <a href='http://gilmourbicycles.us/'>Gilmour</a> that communicated the same thing.</p>

<p>Hilariously, I&#8217;ve had <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/dealingwith/5440032097/'>the same bike for so long now that <em>it</em> gets retro points</a>. It is in fact so old I have to do some research to figure out its lineage.</p>

<p>Another funny thing is that I get the most cred, these days, for being able to do a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_stand'>track stand</a>, which I learned over time while navigating the many traffic lights of Tucson, not at the track where I raced for a few years. As with most things in life, the hardest part of learning how to track stand is starting to learn how to track stand. After some initial mastery of it, it becomes ridiculously simple.</p>

<p>Back to jerseys for a moment. This one really makes me all fuzzy with nostalgia:</p>

<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/sashae/4230909099/in/faves-dealingwith/'><img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4230909099_fb0435d561.jpg' alt='Toshiba jersey' /></a></p>

<p>Maybe now that I&#8217;m an adult I&#8217;ll start collecting frames instead of caps. Spectrums and Gilmours and LeMonds and Sachs and my old Klein. Oh and a <a href='http://fastboycycles.com/'>Fast Boy</a>, of course. I&#8217;ll get one of these to actually ride:</p>

<p><a href='http://prollyisnotprobably.com/2011/02/2011_nahbs_recon_kirk_framewor.php'><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5053/5479836041_52a85770b4_z.jpg' alt='Dave Kirk Terraplane' /></a></p>

<p>(<a href='http://redkiteprayer.com/?p=1772'>Here&#8217;s why</a>.) I have more to show and tell about bicycling and bicycle racing but this post is long enough already. Here are some more images just for fun:</p>

<p><a href='http://prollyisnotprobably.com/2011/03/recent_roll_god_is_in_the_deta.php'><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5211/5496071714_733aa65ce8.jpg' alt='Priorities' /></a></p>

<p>The former above is for after the latter. Yikes! And I leave you with this <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/actu24/3386649913/in/faves-dealingwith/'>link to a picture of Eddy Merckx signing a poster in a butcher shop, which I love for some reason</a>.</p>

<p>I said I might have gained &#8220;the ability to let that which does not matter truly slide&#8221; but I&#8217;m not so sure that is the case. Little things and big things alike will derail me for hours if not days. I guess big things should all be small things now simply by sake of comparison, or by the way my stress and pain scale has been radically recalibrated. Maybe that will be the case in time, but right now I still just feel like my skin is raw. Every little bump or brush up against something causes my pain sensors to overload, preventing my brain to think about anything else and having me reaching for the medicine cabinet.</p>

<p>In terms of determining what is and is not important, that sensor feels like it&#8217;s been reset. I&#8217;ve lost the person that was the most important, that made anything else meaningful. The person that made all the time and pain prior to her arrival worth it. With her gone, it&#8217;s hard to consider anything worth doing or meaningful. She was my grace, and now my grace is gone.</p>

<p>There are many obvious questions in my situation, most of which cycle through my mind like a ferris wheel, each taking their turn stopped in the loading and unloading area. <em>Why?</em> is one <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/05/why.html'>I&#8217;ve mentioned before</a>; I have to some extent decided that question is best escorted out of the park by security. <em>What now?</em> however, that one has made a couple trips around now. I wonder if when that one has left the ride if maybe the ride won&#8217;t stop going around for a while. That would be nice.</p>

<p>On one hand, so many things haven&#8217;t changed. My personality hasn&#8217;t changed that much&#8211;at least not that I can tell. I&#8217;m not more patient or kind or understanding. I&#8217;m not significantly less vain. I&#8217;m not more or less secure.</p>

<p>Some things have changed for the worse. There are now a thousand triggers that might make something in my brain misfire. I care less about what other people think. I drop the f-bomb with more frequency and drink more than I used to&#8230;and I was pretty bad on both counts already.</p>

<p>One thing that <em>might</em> have changed for the better is, in the words Jim Uhls added to <em>Fight Club</em>, the ability to let that which does not matter truly slide.</p>

<p>So what now? There is never any way but forward. Life is shit and life is sweet. We all know that. You just don&#8217;t know how sweet yours is.*</p>

      <![CDATA[<img title='http://www.flickr.com/photos/silverfingers/2462014101/in/faves-dealingwith/ Photo by Hans Hamburger' src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2384/2462014101_8fed19efb6.jpg' />
<p>Today I rode for the 5th day in a row. It probably would have been 10 days except for last Monday and Tuesday off due to two separate TMI ailments. And I must have really &#8220;misunderestimated&#8221; the previous four days because today kicked my ass in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Sunday mornings I&#8217;ve acquired the habit of riding with the group out of <a href='http://ocbicycleco.com/'>Oak Cliff Bicycle Company</a>, probably the only non-pretentious shop or group ride in town. But it&#8217;s <em>hilly</em> and pretty <em>fast</em> and is a great way to take the legs to their limit especially if, like I did today, you&#8217;ve left yourself with not-really-enough left in your legs for such a ride.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ve had the odd pleasure of existing for the rest of my day in an odd haze and <a href='http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5102364950'>as Phil Liggett would say</a> &#8220;legs [that] have turned to rubber&#8221;.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted a couple of times to re-post about <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/10/24/fast-boy.html'>Fast Boy</a>. His blog and our occasional email correspondence have been a great encouragement to me. Although our pain is very different it is similar in its mere existence. He travels through his with an aplomb that is well summed up with this excerpt from <a href='http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/?p=601'>his latest post</a>. It is also such an eloquent description of the dichotomy that is the pain-addled life:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate this pattern of bringing you ever more pitiful news. I sometimes hesitate to write at all, and yet the point is to document this bloody process.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, strangely, I find that I am ever more aware of just how much I love my life. My mind is going at warp speed with ideas.. I&#8217;m excited about getting back to building bikes, but also about lots of other things. I love making these food videos! I&#8217;ve got some music video work coming up that&#8217;s awfully exciting. There are things that I want to write, pieces of hardware that I want to design. Places I want to go.. and yet I&#8217;m falling asleep writing this entry. I&#8217;m beat. I&#8217;m tired. I hurt. It is unbelievably frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Six months and six days. That&#8217;s how long it&#8217;s been. The six month mark passed without event, in fact even the 14th was pretty good, we even had a <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wheeler-Sparks/334053513499'>rock star dinner guest</a>. Tuesday it all fell apart. Wednesday was back to just ok. And so it goes. Now it&#8217;s already Saturday in a WTF kind of speed.</p>

<p>The temperatures have risen to the 80&#8217;s and even though ride preparation takes a few fewer seconds and there&#8217;s less nose blowing during rides*, it feels far, far too soon. Winters are a quiet kind of sad and still. In a way that was helpful. My soul&#8217;s not renewing, so why should the Earth? Anyway, seems all it means is bugs and sweat and wind.</p>

<p>I want to give some kind of meaningful update or information, but everything I&#8217;ve already said still holds true. <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/02/in-order-to-remember-we-must-first-forget.html'>Being reminded of her, or the event, or the loss&#8230;any reminders still must be avoided</a>, the pain is still so debilitating. <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/29/motivation-mood.html'>Motivation is still elusive</a>. <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/11/26/dislikes.html'>Your shit is still really fucking petty</a> and I still really don&#8217;t want to see your babies.</p>

<p>It still seems like I&#8217;m just beating off depression and pain and (honest) sadness and resentment like it&#8217;s my full time job. I just want my daughter back. I just want to be a daddy again. I just want my life back.</p>

<p>I wonder where I fit in the scheme of things. Especially while I am out riding my bike&#8230;which I do almost like a religion nowadays.

I am visited day and night with memories, and no good ones, reenactments of days of pain long passed by.</p>

<p>There may never be another super bowl for me. But death calls out, and life refuses to hear. <strong>It is all wasted on thirty second commercials, selling things no living man has any need of, only dead men spend their money so stupidly.</strong></p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Grewal took part in Wheat Ridge Cyclery&#8217;s Crooked Roubaix, his first competitive event since his retirement. Despite riding a mountain bike, flat pedals and hiking boots, Grewal finished the 90-mile gran fondo-style high-altitude event on dirt and paved roads in the leading group, crossing the line in fourth place out of a field of some 125 starters.</p>

<hr />
<p>I had a long post composed in my mind about how last night&#8217;s spectacle made me lose all hope for humanity, as <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=groupon+super+bowl+commercial' title='and that was only one example of many'>the commercials proved we  no longer have any compassion for our fellow man</a> and the players (and I assume fans) credited God for their good plays. We believe He has an opinion on the matter of sports performance but not, apparently, on human suffering. I also have planned a long post about cycling and the dark cloud that currently looms over its greatest spectacles. I still might write the latter. In the meantime, I am happy to turn this post about the Super Bowl into a post about cycling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe this whole doping issue is here to turn us from our own selfishness to see that we have not as yet realized that the bicycle and bicycle racing has a purpose and meaning we have yet to even think about or care to understand. I think we are missing the real reality of what we have in the bicycle and in the racing of it.</p>

<p>Most of you are living it as well, but after four snow days in a row, having gotten out once since Monday (and Monday I went on a mountain bike ride in regular shorts and jersey) and then only to get <a href='http://twitpic.com/3w60vp'>my tire fixed</a> and re-stock on milk and beer&#8230;well, I&#8217;m over it. I am normally a fan of colder weather but the bike being a rare refuge of late, Texans in general&#8211;and specifically civically&#8211;unprepared for such conditions and 7-year-olds being particularly prone to the more annoying strains of cabin fever have all taken their toll.</p>

<p><img src='http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5060/5417115985_4ae612d9bd.jpg' alt='The fire' /></p>

<p>Last night when the snow started to fall about midnight I kind of resigned to it all. And today our good friend and neighbor Brix had another one of his famous impromptu front porch fetes. Standing by a fire with a beer and a cigar as big flakes continued to fall throughout the afternoon, it wasn&#8217;t so bad. The sun even came out. For about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how my depression has been getting worse. How I have been considering chemical interventions for it. How I remembered how the last time I required anti-depressants it was quite a few months after an event I had to pretty much eradicate from my memory. How I&#8217;m riding my bicycle a whole lot these days trying to beat it off with naturally enhanced endorphins and serotonin and norepinephrine or whatever making yourself hurt on a bicycle does that makes you forget everything and occasionally overly verbose about not much in particular.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how my day job has come to an end and I&#8217;m trying to figure out what to do next. How I&#8217;m working on a new project that has blown past all attempts to deadline it. How I&#8217;m scared shitless to pursue that thing full time because I&#8217;m afraid it will be an abject failure. How I don&#8217;t know if I even want to work right now except that funds are down after the medical bills and the property taxes and the etc.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how I don&#8217;t know where that property tax bill went. How I don&#8217;t remember seeing it cross my desk. How hard it is to do normal shit these days.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how this morning on my drive to a morning group ride my trunk lid came loose and I had to pull over into a parking lot of an empty little office building on the I-30 service road just east of Grand. The same god damn parking lot that I pulled over into the day we were told she was probably not going to make it, and I couldn&#8217;t drive any more because I was losing my shit. And this morning I had to pull into that same parking lot because of my god damn trunk lid, and when I came to a stop instead of balling and balling and begging God and begging God I just cursed at him. I cursed at him like Cee Lo Green except without melody and with a lot more anger and bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about how two people total have downloaded my last record in the 6 days since I released it and how that&#8217;s about 0.3% of my Twitter followers alone. And one of those people is my Mom, who isn&#8217;t on Twitter anyway.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about what a fine cook my wife is and about the homemade veggie red curry she made tonight and the friends we had over and whose company we enjoyed.</p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about the mean strangers on the internet who probably thought I wouldn&#8217;t read their comments about me and about this blog and about how <em>stupid</em> it was that I had <a href='http://www.ftrain.com/wwic.html'>not consulted</a> them about how best to grieve. <em>&#8220;What Daniel needs to do is&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>

<p>&#8230;could tell you about all the failed attempts my brain has made at creating some semblance of a tautology for this thing. How none of my experience or faith or culture has provided any tools for dealing with it. How they have only provided frameworks that crumble under its weight, pain for their attempts at grace, crumbling ruins for their attempts at meaning.</p>

<p>&#8230;but I don&#8217;t really feel like it.</p>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<p class='media'><object data='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3895428586/size=grande3/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' type='text/html' height='410' width='300'> </object></p>
<p>In 2003 I lived in Bosnia for a few months and while there recorded a little four-song EP, the <em>Americana EP</em>. I was really proud of it, it was my first time working with a producer and it was my first project since 1997. I&#8217;ll have to &#8220;re-print&#8221; the epic story of the Bosnian disc reproduction <em>mofiasco</em> on here soon for those who haven&#8217;t already heard it.</p>

<p>After the first <em><a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/happy-sounding-sad-songs'>Happy Sounding Sad Songs</a></em> sessions I wasn&#8217;t quite happy with the collection. There were a few songs on it that sounded like they belonged more with the previous <em>Americana EP</em> than with the rest of their companions on <em>HSSS</em>. I tabled those three, recorded two new ones <em>(<a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/i-dont-know-what-to-do-about-that' title='I Don&apos;t Know What to do About That'>IDKWTDAT</a> &amp; <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/clich]'>Clich&#233;</a>)</em>, and that was that.</p>

<p>I had it in my mind to re-work <em>Americana</em> since then. The original EP only used sampled drums and on a couple of the songs they sounded, well, sampled. I wanted real drums on those, combine them with the 3 stragglers from <em>HSSS</em>, ignore the fact that someone without a career has no place releasing a B-sides compilation, and whammo: new record.</p>

<p>Well it took a while to get around to re-working those old tracks. I had to find a studio that could import them. Then we discovered my producer back in Sarajevo had made a mistake with the backups, and I was missing most of one of the songs. We worked on the other three, adding new guitars and drums and some keys. We mixed more professionally. I mashed-up a little ending for <em>Closed</em> that harkens forward to the (now-past) remake of <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/american-dream-town'><em>Dream Town</em> on <em>HSSS</em></a>. I ended up throwing out one more song.</p>

<p>Anyway, everything was ready to go last summer. Then some stuff happened.</p>

<p>Anyway, here it is.</p>
