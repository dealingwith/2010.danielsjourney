<p>I thought maybe this experience was going to make me a better person in many respects, but in particular my intolerance for certain things. Not so. In no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>People who leave voicemail. Not <em>everyone</em> who leave voicemails, but for example I was on a flight the other day and the guy next to me left the longest voicemail in the history of voicemails. It was so long I had to send Carissa a text message informing her of my bewilderment at his ability to monologue into a voice recording device. <em>However</em>, on the return flight of the same trip, another douchebag next to me, who must have become aware of the new Voicemail Message Length world record, proceeded to leave a voicemail <em>no shorter than</em> 10 minutes long! It was seriously unbelievable, and I had to continually challenge reality as he continued on and on. It was very much like the business douchebag on the plane in <a href='http://vod.fxnetworks.com/watch/louie/221105606001'>this Louie episode</a>, except much longer and as a message not a conversation.</li>

<li>Related: People who have jobs that mostly involve writing emails and still hunt-and-peck type.</li>

<li>People who use Twitter hashtags <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23stabmyself'>#stabmyself</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23FML'>#FML</a>. <a href='http://collecta.com/s/STFU'>STFU</a> and <a href='http://collecta.com/s/GTFOI'>GTFOI</a>.</li>

<li>Related: Drama Kings and Queens. Having struggled my way into a B in Evolutionary Psychology 15 years ago, I&#8217;m well aware that our lizard brain controls us for the majority of our day and our days are the most boring of all history. No tigers chasing us through the jungle, no rival tribes to compete with over food and quality mates, so we have to make our own drama to replace the lack of actual, life-threatening drama. The continued erosion of any real meaning in our lives has caused that drama to revolve around increasingly asinine subject matter.</li>

<li>Your driving. Protip: hang up the fucking phone.</li>

<li>Your causes. Are just more bad replacements for that tiger chasing you. If you enact real change in this world it isn&#8217;t going to be via your goddamn Facebook account.</li>

<li>Your children. Honestly. They are annoying and ugly (except when they&#8217;re perfect and beautiful but really it doesn&#8217;t matter) and worst of all (and I don&#8217;t mean this in the maniacal way it will sound) <em>still alive</em>.</li>

<li>The neighbor&#8217;s dog. He seriously will. not. stop. barking.</li>

<li>Opinions other than my own.</li>
</ul>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5195708177_ab4bb4384c_o.jpg' title='Photo by Kate Mackley http://www.flickr.com/photos/katemackley/5078499695/in/photostream/' />
<p>The reason <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/memorial'>the Memorial record</a> happened now instead of next year or never is because of Chris Holt. We planned the Memorial service in just a couple of days, during a time that I can barely remember, and Chris was incredibly helpful during that time. His new record <a href='http://chrisholt.bandcamp.com/album/a-cosmic-joke'>A Cosmic Joke</a> wasn&#8217;t quite out yet, but he sent us a couple songs from it as possibilities to play at the memorial and we were just floored by them. He continued to go above and beyond by reworking the lyrics of <a href='http://chrisholt.bandcamp.com/track/always-in-awe'>Always in Awe</a>* and learning a new arrangement of <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/ill-fly-away'>I&#8217;ll Fly Away</a> within about 24 hours.</p>
<p><object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' data='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1911303341/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' height='100' type='text/html' width='400'><param name='movie' value='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1911303341/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='allowNetworking' value='always' /><param name='wmode' value='transparent' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='never' /><embed data='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1911303341/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' height='100' type='text/html' width='400' /></object></p>
<p>I later told Chris I had a thought to create a collection of the songs played that night. A couple of weeks later he sent me a message that he had made arrangements with <a href='http://www.salimnourallah.com/'>Salim</a> to go into <a href='http://www.pleasantrylane.com/'>Pleasantry Lane</a> to record his tunes. It took a few weeks to finally get into the studio, during which time I sent messages to Doug, The Beaten Sea and Salim, who all agreed to participate in the project. Doug already had some acoustic recordings of the songs from <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q8GBVM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwdanielsjou-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001Q8GBVM'>The Shawl</a>. Salim recorded acoustic versions of his two songs during the sessions with Chris. And Benj from The Beaten Sea came in one night to record his version of <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/adios-au-revoir-auf-wiedersehen'>Adios, Au Revoir, Auf Wiedersehen</a>, which will now forever win as most beautiful sad song of all time.</p>
<p><object classid='clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000' data='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2818574578/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' height='100' type='text/html' width='400'><param name='movie' value='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2818574578/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='allowNetworking' value='always' /><param name='wmode' value='transparent' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='allowScriptAccess' value='never' /><embed data='http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=2818574578/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB//' height='100' type='text/html' width='400' /></object></p>
<p>It even turned out that The Beaten Sea and I use the same mastering engineer, so he already had the original of <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/its-hard-to-resist'>It&#8217;s Hard to Resist</a> that he could master to the same level as the rest of the record. Oh, and he donated his time to the project as well, despite never having met me in real life. The hardest part was deciding on a title, choosing between the four different cover art versions <a href='http://vladimirzimakov.com/'>Vladimir</a> sent (I included two in the download) and listening to the masters when they came back.</p>

<p>The record that means the most to me, I can&#8217;t even listen to.</p>
<p class='date'>November 21, 2010</p><p class='postscript'>* i.e., <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/say-goodbye-always-in-awe'>the version on the Memorial collection</a> is one of a kind, available nowhere else. This is actually true of all the tracks on the record except one, but <span style='font-style:italic'>Always in Awe</span> is the only one with different lyrics than the original.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5192182683_f4d53e64fb.jpg' title='Memorial cover art by Vladimir Zimakov http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/memorial' />
<p>There is a lot more to say about the why and the how of <a href='http://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/memorial'>this record</a>, but for now I&#8217;ll just say this: It feels a little crassumer to say but it feels good when you buy this record. I had originally planned to offer the download for free but Bandcamp instituted free download limits since then so the $1 download charge just prevents me from having to worry about those limits. Since deciding to charge for it, my thoughts about the nature of the project changed a little bit and I really felt like I wanted to be able to give back to all the artists that participated in its creation. So when you buy the record, in this really weird way, it means it mattered to you too that these artists would contribute their valuable time and considerable talent towards this artifact of remembrance.</p>

<p>Thought of a good metaphor the other day: it&#8217;s like somebody walks in every hour on the hour and punches you in the stomach. By late afternoon, you get tired of being punched in the stomach every hour and try doing something else. By early evening you decide to self medicate to try and calm the pain in your gut. By late evening the ache is keeping you up, daring you to go lie down and be quiet for a moment, long enough to not think about anything other than it.</p>

<p>This, of course, is an improvement from being constantly punched in the gut.</p>
<p class='date'>November 16, 2010</p><p class='postscript'>Did you know Houdini was killed by someone punching him in the gut? Houdini had claimed to be able to withstand anyone punching him in the stomach, so some douchebag bust into his green room back stage at a show and punched him repeatedly in the stomach while he was laying on a couch. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Houdini#Death'>Houdini died of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix</a>, apparently performing either earlier the same day or the day prior.</p>]]>

<li>I&#8217;m still mostly sad.</li>

<li>I still miss my daughter all the time.</li>

<li>Happy times are still marked by her absence.</li>

<li>Everything would be perfect if she were still here.</li>

<li>I&#8217;m still ready for a fight that won&#8217;t come and wouldn&#8217;t help anything anyway.</li>

<li>I still exist in a world that continues on despite all these things.</li>

<li>I still struggle to resist the urge to just totally drop out.</li>

<li>I still feel really betrayed but I&#8217;m not sure with whom.</li>

<li>I would still do anything to have her back again.</li>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<p class='media'><object height='340' width='560'><param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/i3HyRtdu1o0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US' /><param name='allowFullScreen' value='true' /><param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always' /><embed allowfullscreen='true' allowscriptaccess='always' height='340' src='http://www.youtube.com/v/i3HyRtdu1o0?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' width='560' /></object></p>
<p>First, some errata: I realized only after a night&#8217;s sleep that I did not go on anti-depressants 9 months after my divorce (<a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/10/27/tooth-fairy.html'>as I said</a>) but rather 18 or so. It was after <em>yet another</em> critical experience following my relocation to Texas. It was this double beat-down (as it were) that led to a kind of retreat/regroup that involved, eventually, anti-depressants.</p>

<p>Another thing that occurred to me only after a day&#8217;s passing was in regard to a private conversation I had. I was asked if I felt isolated (within a specific context) and I replied that I did; but I realized today that it&#8217;s not that context&#8211;I feel isolated in this experience. <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/29/motivation-mood.html' title='You all have moved on, more or less.'>I subconsciously mention this fact in this post</a>. <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/10/24/fast-boy.html' title='Ezra and I, we have been forced to exist in a space that not many understand.'>It is also the theme of the Fast Boy post</a>.</p>

<p>The experience of this loss, it is this constant contrast to everything else in life. All the pleasure those around me experience, even their pathetic losses (especially their pathetic losses), even that pleasure I attempt to experience myself, I can&#8217;t help but measure it against this pain. In a time when living in the moment might be more important than ever, I am able only to look backwards and forwards, this spiral of desire and loss, isolation and depression. <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/10/04/in-the-light-of-prior-suffering.html'>That I previously wrote about suffering is absurd</a>, that I write about this even now is equally so. In the face of the ultimate mystery of our existence, what is there to say, how is one to think, behave, speak? How does one coexist?</p>

<p>Returning to some of the thinkers that have influenced me in the past is being of some help today, hence the video I share here.</p>

<p>This morning, Penn sulked slowly down the hallway and plopped on the couch. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t come.&#8221; He looked up at me with the biggest crocodile tears you have ever seen and I couldn&#8217;t bear to lie for that neglectful tooth fairy woman again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the side effects of the <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/17/insomnia.html'>insomnia</a>, which Carissa has been combating by falling asleep cuddled up next to me on the couch while I wait still for sleep to come, is the acceleration of certain veil-liftings like <a href='http://carissabyers.blogspot.com/2010/10/lost-tooth-and-tooth-fairy.html'>who the tooth fairy really is</a>.</p>
<p style='text-align:center;font-size:2em;font-weight:bold'>...</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of bad days, days where most of real life is ignored, thoughts wander towards darkness and have to be reigned in by distraction, self-medication starts early, and sleep comes late after a handful of pills. At last week&#8217;s appointment my therapist said, &#8220;Are you <em>sure</em> you don&#8217;t want to take something?&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been on anti-depressants before; I have a degree in psychology, I&#8217;ve been self-monitoring my depression for years now. It took 9 months after my divorce (in 2004) for the shock to turn into real depression, and I was on a cocktail of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressants'>psychoactives</a> for a year.* In 2007 I had another similar crisis and tried a new anti-depressant for about a day before giving up based on those horrible side effects.</p>

<p>Since emerging from that series of bad decisions I&#8217;ve used St John&#8217;s wort with success to combat a pretty regular depression onset. Since August I&#8217;ve been trying to maintain a regular St John&#8217;s regimen. Today I started with double my normal dose, which probably puts me at the recommended daily dose; but I&#8217;m getting the sense that its potency is wearing off. Or what it is trying to fight is getting stronger.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not as concerned (yet) about a drug decision as I am about what this thing is turning into. There have been cycles of &#8220;It&#8217;s getting better&#8221; that alternate with cycles of &#8220;No, it&#8217;s getting worse.&#8221; <a href='http://2010.danielsjourney.com/2010/09/02/in-order-to-remember-we-must-first-forget.html'>The original post of this blog</a> is still just as applicable now as it was then. The amount I miss her every day is unmeasurable, and everything sucks without her.</p>

<p>I need a Tooth Fairy Moment. I need to know what is true, and what this terrain yet holds so I can prepare for it.</p>

    <content type='html' xml:lang='en' xml:base='http://danielsjourney.com/'>
      <![CDATA[<img src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5038467393_ed3dfabee9.jpg' title='home by fast boy http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/5038467393/in/photostream/' />
<p>The first thing you should know about <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/'>Fast Boy</a> (aka Ezra) is: he makes bikes. <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/collections/72157623961829924/'>Amazingly beautiful bikes</a>. Bikes doubling as works of art or works of art doubling as bikes, I can&#8217;t decide which. This is how I stumbled across his Flickr; I&#8217;ve found there are few bike nerds out there that do not know of his creations.</p>
<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/4606106327/' title='Untitled by fast boy, on Flickr'><img alt='' height='335' src='http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/4606106327_cc17338bb2.jpg' width='500' /></a>
<p><a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/2678131886/in/set-72157607075926461/'>In 2008 Ezra found out he had cancer</a>. He had chemo, radiation and surgery and fought it off in knightly fashion. Last May, he celebrated <a href='http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/?p=379'>one year cancer free</a>.</p>

<p>Then, in September, <a href='http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/?p=383'>it came back</a>. This time, <a href='http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/?p=385'>the surgery even more severe</a>. More chemo starts soon.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a weird clich&#233; to experience, but this sense of knowing of someone else&#8217;s completely different but equally indescribably horrible experience is comforting. Not in a &#8220;I&#8217;m not alone&#8221; sense, though. I&#8217;m not supposing uniqueness, but people like Ezra and I, we have been forced to exist in a space that not many understand. We will never say <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/search/FML' title='&apos;fuck my life&apos; -- e.g. &apos;Missed the bus FML&apos;'>FML</a>. The fact that our lives are fucked is self evident, every day. But we still must live those days.</p>

<p>And Ezra <em>lives</em>. He <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/5054541856/in/photostream/'>cooks</a>, enjoys the company of friends, takes pictures of his hot wife, plays with his <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastboy/4990523812/'>dog</a> and maintains a will strong enough to say <a href='http://www.fastboycycles.com/teachingcancertocry/'>&#8220;fuck cancer&#8221;</a> in a way no one ever doubts. Even though his body cannot lift it, I know his mind is crafting new beauty from steel.</p>

<p>Fast Boy&#8217;s circumstances are different than mine, but having both been burdened with the terrible fullness of what life can hold, there is a common fight to be had for the good parts. I only know him through his words and his lens, but he inspires me in that fight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I &#160;got something with your name on it. Stick with me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Remember before they turned on the carnival? All the folded rides, dead lights. That white kid from the funnel-cake trailer, one used to suck his toe at the pool. One always singing, &#8216;I&#8217;m so full of ideas, and here is the good one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah him. You know Troy. He gave it to me. Said you might need it. Had it in his trunk in a Hefty bag, under a roll of orange electric cord and some lumps of bloody butcher paper. He had funnel cakes&#8211;stacked in paper plates and packing tape&#8211;told me forget those, said they wouldn&#8217;t travel well. He was on his way to a bus, a barbecue. Told me if anyone asks, say something like, &#8216;Ain&#8217;t seen him long as I can remember. Wouldn&#8217;t know where he is.&#8217; Say something like that he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So here it is. If no package accompanies this letter, call me. If it&#8217;s been opened, interrogate mailman. If none of this means anything to you, I don&#8217;t know what to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Troy said meet him in The Rusty Scupper parking lot at such-and-such a whenever. I pulled up and he&#8217;s already there, sitting on his fender with the trunk open. Had these rubber gloves on to hold the garbage bag. Huge ones, blue, kind for industrial dishes, radioactive food. And he was real anxious, all jumpy on strings. Handed me this stiff thing wrapped in brown paper. It creaked. He wouldn&#8217;t let me put it in my car. &#8216;Not right after I just handed it to you,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Take it inside, they&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a birthday present.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Who?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whoever&#8217;s watching,&#8217; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p class='date'>October 23, 2010</p><p class='postscript'>From <span style='font-style:italic'>I Got Something with Your Name on It</span>, part of <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802139639?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwdanielsjou-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802139639' style='font-style:italic'>Gigantic</a> by Marc Nesbitt, the inspiration for an installation I did in 2004 that none of you will get to see again even if you pay me. Well, maybe if you paid me enough I would re-work the installation into something I would be satisfied with now.</p>]]>
