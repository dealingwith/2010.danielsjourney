<p>Last night after an extended nightmare I won&rsquo;t describe I dreamt about Lucy. She was almost a toddler in my dream. She had light, slightly curly hair. She was longer, her baby fat stretched out a bit more along almost gangly limbs. She had light, bright eyes. But she did have Margot&rsquo;s smile.</p>

<p>In my dream Lucy was noticeably tough and opinionated, even at that age. Even pre-language. She was concerned with the insulation of our family and with protecting that. She was sensitive but not in weak way, rather in an assertive way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a hard time this week with my thoughts. I realized not long ago that these thoughts and feelings weren&rsquo;t going to go away, I was just going to learn how to live with them better. Like a permanent injury, I journey now with a limp. Some days it&rsquo;s easier to walk on than others, some days I hide the defect in my stride better than others.</p>

<p>Lucy&rsquo;s more imminent arrival is causing no small amount of anxiety and remembering. I&rsquo;m ready for her to be here. To be completely real to me. Carissa carries her around and gets to feel her move all day long. To me&mdash;until that dream&mdash;she was more abstract and therefore more evocative of the past. Margot was everything to me. It&rsquo;s hard to go through the activities of preparing for Lucy&rsquo;s birth when all those things were for Margot. Her room. Her house. Everything.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m grateful for the dream&hellip;it&rsquo;s something to hold in my mind as I continue putting one foot in front of the other.</p>

<p>Yesterday I rode 100 miles in one day for the first time ever. Considering how many miles I rode &ldquo;back in the day&rdquo; when I raced in high school and college, this is a little hard to believe, but although I&rsquo;d ridden a couple 90 milers climbing to the top of Mt. Lemmon in Tucson before, I had never topped the mythical 100 mile mark.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been training for it for a while, gradually upping my milage every weekend for the last couple of months as well as scoping out roads. I didn&rsquo;t just want to ride one 50 mile loop twice, I wanted one single, solid 100 mile loop that left from my house. That meant decent roads with low traffic&mdash;neither are easy to come by in Dallas.</p>

<p>On top of that it was rather windy on the scheduled day and I have two friends, Ean and Jeff, to thank for my successful trip around the loop. I drafted a lot. So much so I might need to set another goal of a solo century ride.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6224/6274589513_9dfc697f83.jpg" alt="Proof!" /></p>

<hr>


<p>At one point, somewhere in the last 25 miles of the ride, I was by myself in the hills southeast of Mesquite, and I started singing <em>Warriors of Love</em> by my friend Salim Nourallah. It&rsquo;s off a record he&rsquo;s not released yet, except to those who pledged to it prior to its production.</p>

<p><span class="audioplayer"><span id="audioplayer_1"><a href="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/files/08%20Warriors%20of%20Love.mp3">Salim Nourallah &ndash; Warriors of Love</a></span></span></p>

<p>As I sung the first line of the chorus&mdash;<em>now is the time, to go the way of the warriors</em>&mdash;I felt chills flow across my body and I knew they weren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;bonk chills&rdquo;, despite my fatigue.*</p>

<p>It felt very much like her presence. It is a feeling I desire every day. And it was a tiny blessing that I am grateful for.</p>

<p class="date">October 23, 2011</p>




<p class="postscript">* ...those came about 5 miles later. They are distinct in that they actually feel cold, despite the heat.

<blockquote><p>The problem is I&rsquo;m older now, I&rsquo;m 40 years old, and this stuff doesn&rsquo;t change the world. It really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s true. Having children really changes your view on these things. We&rsquo;re born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It&rsquo;s been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much&mdash;if at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These technologies can make life easier, can let us touch people we might not otherwise. You may have a child with a birth defect and be able to get in touch with other parents and support groups, get medical information, the latest experimental drugs. These things can profoundly influence life. I&rsquo;m not downplaying that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a disservice to constantly put things in this radical new light&mdash;that it&rsquo;s going to change everything. Things don&rsquo;t have to change the world to be important.&rdquo; [<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/4.02/jobs_pr.html">Wired, February 1996</a>]</p></blockquote>

<hr>


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We think the Mac will sell zillions, but we didn&rsquo;t build the Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren&rsquo;t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you&rsquo;re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s there, so you&rsquo;re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.&rdquo; [<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/43945579/Playboy-Interview-With-Steve-Jobs">Playboy, Feb. 1, 1985</a>]</p></blockquote>

<hr>


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it&rsquo;s really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn&rsquo;t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&rsquo;t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That&rsquo;s because they were able to connect experiences they&rsquo;ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they&rsquo;ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven&rsquo;t had very diverse experiences. So they don&rsquo;t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one&rsquo;s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.&rdquo; [Wired, February 1996]</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously rich, they&rsquo;re gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives. Without it, they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective.&rdquo; [Fortune, Jan. 24, 2000]</p></blockquote>

      <![CDATA[<p><img src="http://2010.danielsjourney.com/images/commute-panda.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>Today I rode by bicycle to work for the second day in a row. I changed the gearing on this particular bike to be somewhat easy to pedal as well as making it a fixed gear bicycle* (it can be &ldquo;flipped&rdquo; between fixed and free). This makes it much easier to get started from a stop, especially given the total weight of bike, cargo-carrying accessories, and cargo itself combined. It also keeps me at a slow optimal speed and therefore a lower level of perspiration. The one thing the fixed gear specifically requires, however, is using the legs for braking power. And wow have my legs been sore from that!</p>

<p>There are many things I want to complain about today, but then I think about how I had lunch at <a href="http://www.charliepalmer.com/Properties/CharliePalmerAtJoule/">Charlie Palmer</a> and <a href="http://www.cigarzpizza.com/">Cigarz</a>** pizza and <a href="http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/blogs/99bottles/2011/08/review_stone_escondidian_imper.html">Stone Black IPA</a> for dinner (followed by a Full Sail Sanctuary), and rode one bike to work and another bike after work and I realize that I can&rsquo;t complain, really.</p>

<p>(I was going to say something profound here but didn&rsquo;t. Instead of letting this post lay in drafts I&rsquo;m just going to publish it as-is.)</p>

<p class="date">October 04, 2011</p>




<p class="postscript">* the move to fixed had its own reasoning&mdash;the freewheel was making all kinds of annoying noises. To get a non-noisy freewheel, apparently, takes some dough. (This is my second &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; freewheel so far.) The inconvenience of riding fixed will take some time to justify spending $100 on a good one.<br><br>** Dallas people if you have not had this pizza it's OMG good. Get the Greek Pizza.</p>

<p>I now have a series of posts lined up but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll finish any of them, so I&rsquo;m just going to post stuff as it becomes concise enough to post, which means it will probably be out of order and incoherent as a whole. Also please excuse me if on this post and possibly others I&rsquo;m just re-writing <a href="http://peterrollins.net/">Pete Rollins</a> in my own words and for my own benefit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wiley Coyote Retires&rdquo; (which is NSFW unless you work somewhere awesome like Extra Sauce) does a really good job of addressing what happens when one achieves their desire, when their desire is achievable (for example, as we say in the technology startup world, &ldquo;fuck you money&rdquo;). Of course those who have had success rarely retire early to their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqjGPIYJsh0">special island</a>, they usually insert themselves into others' brilliance by becoming an angel investor or venture capitalist or special advisor (which somehow seems like retiring from porn to become a fluffer), or they just go do <a href="http://denniscrowley.com/">the exact same thing over again</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mlkshk.com/p/7TL4"><img src="http://mlkshk.com/r/7TL4"></a></p>

<p>Or, as my former business partner Dan and I used to joke, they develop a mandatory coke habit. And the idea that having enough money means a freedom from anxiety about money <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1xdq0_notorious-big-mo-money-mo-problem_music">just isn&rsquo;t true</a>. Besides, where would you be without all that misplaced anxiety? You&rsquo;d simply misplace it elsewhere. Billionaires and soccer moms and spoiled children are all pretty much the same thing.</p>

<iframe width="490" height="279" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/R8vJgYQU_lY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><a href="http://peterrollins.net/?p=1795">Pete&rsquo;s answer to this problem is</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps there is another possibility, if we are lucky enough to find it. And that is in finding and being with the one we love. In being with the one we love we gain what we desire while remaining at a distance from it. When we love someone they are present to us as a mystery. They are the opening to, and encounter with, otherness itself. They are a vast and endless ocean.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which at the moment just leaves me here in my loss, and in my fears of potential loss. (Pete is probably talking about an existential love with some more abstract &ldquo;other&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ll allow him his own continued thinking on these matters and not conjecture further on his conclusions.)</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m close to wrapping my head around a third way that might illuminate a way forward. This stuff gets all smashed together with meaning and identity formation&hellip; [to be continued]</p>

<br><br>


<p>I don&rsquo;t want anything else.</p>

<p>I would give up every penny I have, every penny I will ever have, to have her back.</p>

<p>I would give up everything, every last moment of pleasure, to have her back.</p>

<p>Hell. I would give up all of it for 5 minutes with her.</p>

<p>In conversation yesterday the date December 8th came up and I slipped, &ldquo;December 8th is Margot&rsquo;s&mdash;I mean Lucy&rsquo;s&mdash;due date.&rdquo; I was smiling&mdash;the emotion and anticipation of Lucy&rsquo;s arrival thrown across my face&mdash;as I made the mistake and the dissonance between what I was thinking and what my ears heard my mouth say was distinct.</p>

<p>Certainly, things are getting easier, in terms of emotionally surviving every day, in terms of emotionally surviving the constant reminders and triggers. But Lucy being both an unspeakable joy and a trigger is certainly an interesting case study in how life never allows for clear distinctions, or for real existential comfort whatsoever.</p>

<hr>


<p>On the other hand, I often feel oddly privileged by my lack of concern for those things that often trouble those untouched by such unfortunate experiences. But while I&rsquo;m much more able to exist in the moment, I also live in constant fear of what the following moment could contain.</p>

<p>Money, and its concerns either in abundance or decline? No problem! My family driving <em>anywhere</em> without me? Horror at the innumerable threats that stand between them and their safe return.</p>

<p>Strife&mdash;others' conflicts, stressors, disfunctions&mdash;when it finds its way into my experience? Ha! But let your toddler wander farther than five feet from you and I get a shot of fear-induced adrenaline through my veins.</p>

<hr>


<p>But those concerns reflect values, and I&rsquo;m left observing my own from a strange distance, noticing how they have changed in a way I probably would have never known except perhaps through old age. Still, these values won&rsquo;t make me more successful in the world&rsquo;s eyes (although I&rsquo;m open to the chance, don&rsquo;t get me wrong). They don&rsquo;t make me immune to anything in particular. They&rsquo;ve just given me access&hellip;to what I&rsquo;m still trying to determine.</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1965, in his studio in Warsaw, Opa&#x142;ka began painting a process of counting &#x2013; from one to infinity. Starting in the top left-hand corner of the canvas and finishing in the bottom right-hand corner, the tiny numbers were painted in horizontal rows. Each new canvas, which the artist called a &lsquo;detail&rsquo;, took up counting where the last left off. Each &lsquo;detail&rsquo; is the same size (196 x 135 cm), the dimension of his studio door in Warsaw. All details have the same title, &ldquo;1965 / 1 &#x2013; &infin;&rdquo;; the concept had no end, and the artist pledged his life to its execution: &lsquo;All my work is a single thing, the description from number one to infinity. A single thing, a single life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The final number he wrote was 5,607,249</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://wheelersparks.com/2011/09/a-note-from-author-john-graves/">Wheeler Sparks</a>:</p>

<br><br>


<blockquote><p>&hellip;to swallow ground by bus and train and foot and still only just reach the crest of the wave where everyone else is headed soon, of course there is a sadness there. A fading sense of discovery. Where can we go to feel we have truly explored?</p></blockquote>

<p>Time is marching on as it tends to do. Bad days are less frequent and more vague in their symptoms (yet today is one). I feel like so much of what I&rsquo;ve written about here is about running away from <em>then</em> either into the distant past or into some more present present, like exploring geographic and emotional territories on my bicycle (actually the bicycle is the perfect combination of nostalgia and forward movement). Oh, and drinking. To some extent I&rsquo;ve allowed myself all of this due to the simple fact that the pain of thinking about Margot&mdash;even typing her name&mdash;is so horrible, so vast, so overwhelming that I&rsquo;ve had no choice but avoid it or be consumed by it.</p>

<p>But it calls like a distant wind. The trees rustle on the periphery and there is no stopping that invisible force, it will soon be on your face. And while it is sometimes a touch, this is Texas and it is usually a punch.</p>

<p>It seems that for her, and for her sister&rsquo;s sake, I will need to turn and face it. I just wish I knew what that meant.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people are out there who wish you would not use the anniversary of their loss to be patriotic. To repeat trite adages. To hashtag where you were when they lost the person that was most important to them. To make their loss about the flag and about terrorists and about yourself.</p>

<p>You extract meaning from their pain. You think the event is important to you. But this moment means nothing to you compared to them.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s possible they would just like to spend a moment in mourning and then move on.</p>
